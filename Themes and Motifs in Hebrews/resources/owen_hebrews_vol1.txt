At the time of his coming, the Jews were generally as

they knew not how they could be.

And therefore when-

were filled with rage and madnefs, [John viii. 58, 59.]

They would flone him, becaufe, being a man, he declared
himfelf to be God, [John x. 30, 31, 33.] and yet, when
he proved it to them that the Messiah was to be fo, (inafmuch as, being David's fon, David in the fpirit called

And v^ho will lay any weight upon what is fpokcn, or

Again, their maflers have not only dealt difhoneftly and

And what proportion doth

a man's being
where his army is victorious (which is all
the hardihip this Ben Joseph is to meet with) bear to the
affli£tions which befell the church in every age ? And it
is mere loft labour, to compare the death of this warrior
with what is delivered in fcripture, concerning the Meffiah.

that there is no affinity between them.

That which now lies before us, is, to inquire more exfacrifice

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='introduction'><span class='titlemark'>1   </span> <a id='x1-10001'></a>Introduction</h3>

<!-- l. 113 --><p class='noindent'>The Book of Hebrews, a profound epistle in the New Testament, is a theological masterpiece

crafted to encourage early Jewish Christians to remain steadfast in their faith in Jesus Christ

amidst pressures to revert to Judaism. After discussing the book’s Old Testament foundation,

this essay explores the six most dominant themes in Hebrews—namely, the supremacy

of Christ, the new covenant, the priesthood of Christ, faith and perseverance, the

call to holiness and worship, and the critical warning against failing to trust fully

in Christ’s sufficient atonement. It also examines how the motifs of rest, covenant

fulfilment, access to God’s presence, and perfection interweave these themes, serving as

unifying threads that underscore the book’s message of salvation through faith in Christ

alone.

</p><!-- l. 125 --><p class='indent'>   This essay argues that Hebrews employs its themes and motifs to exhort believers to trust

fully in Christ’s finished work, fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament.

<a id='x1-1001r1'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='reliance-on-the-old-testament'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> <a id='x1-20002'></a>Reliance on the Old Testament</h3>

<!-- l. 129 --><p class='noindent'>The Book of Hebrews heavily relies on the Old Testament to construct its theological

arguments, grounding its claims about Christ in the scriptures familiar to its Jewish

Christian audience. As John Calvin observes in his argument introducing the

epistle, Hebrews demonstrates how the figures and shadows of the Law find their

fulfilment in Christ, and how the promises given to the fathers are accomplished in

Him”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Calvin1853' title='Calvin1853'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2001f1'></a> 

Ian Mackervoy similarly observes that the epistle “argues from the Old Testament to keep [its

readers] trusting in Christ,” weaving quotations and exposition into a pastoral appeal for

perseverance.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>2</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2002f2'></a> 

Hebrews includes direct quotations from the Septuagint, drawn from texts like the Psalms,

Jeremiah, and Leviticus (e.g., Ps 95 in Heb 3:7–11; Jer 31:31–34 in Heb 8:8–12). These

quotations, often introduced with phrases like “as it is written” or “the Holy Spirit says,”

emphasise their authoritative role. Beyond direct quotes, Hebrews frequently alludes to Old

Testament figures (e.g., Melchizedek in Heb 7; Moses in Heb 3) and events (e.g., the wilderness

wandering in Heb 3–4), using them as types or shadows fulfilled in Christ. Indirect

references permeate the book’s discussions of the Law, sacrifices, and priesthood, which

assume familiarity with Old Testament institutions (e.g., Lev 16 in Heb 9). This

grounding in familiar scriptures bolstered the author’s appeal to Jewish Christians facing

temptation to either abandon Christ, or to see Christ as an addition to the Levitical

ordinances.

</p><!-- l. 159 --><p class='indent'>   In terms of sheer volume, Dana M. Harris collates tallies that range

from thirty-two to thirty-seven explicit quotations of the Old Testament

alongside dozens of allusions, underlining how saturated the sermon is with

Scripture.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Harris2021' title='Harris2021'><sup class='textsuperscript'>3</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2003f3'></a>  She

therefore concludes that “the prevalence of the Old Testament is one of the most striking features of the Epistle

to the Hebrews”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Harris2021' title='Harris2021'><sup class='textsuperscript'>4</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2004f4'></a> 

</p><!-- l. 167 --><p class='indent'>   This pervasive Old Testament engagement anchors Hebrews’ argument that Christ

fulfills and surpasses the old covenant, making the Old Testament indispensable to its

message.

<a id='x1-2005r2'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-supremacy-of-christ'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> <a id='x1-30003'></a>The Supremacy of Christ</h3>

<!-- l. 171 --><p class='noindent'>At the heart of Hebrews lies the theme of Christ’s supremacy, portraying Him as superior to all

figures and institutions of the Old Testament. Hebrews 1:1–4 establishes Jesus as the eternal

Son of God, the ultimate revelation who surpasses angels, Moses, and the Levitical priesthood,

fulfilling Old Testament prophecies (e.g., Ps 2:7; 2 Sam 7:14). Jonathan Edwards, preaching on

Christ’s infinite greatness, declared that our Saviour “is infinitely great and high above all… He

is higher than the highest angels of heaven… angels themselves are as nothing before

him.”<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Edwards1981' title='Edwards1981'><sup class='textsuperscript'>5</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3001f5'></a> 

As the Creator and Sustainer of all things (Heb 1:3), Christ therefore alone reigns at the

Father’s right hand as the supreme Mediator. In short, “[Christ] has received a more

excellent name than Moses” and a priesthood “after the order of Melchizedek” that far

surpasses Aaron’s (Heb 3:3; 7:17). Christ’s glory and authority are thus presented

throughout Hebrews 1–4 as utterly beyond any angel or human minister, securing full

access to God’s presence and the completeness of salvation. Christ’s supremacy, as

the eternal Son and High Priest, not only fulfils the Old Testament promises of a

Messiah but also secures for believers the ultimate rest that the old covenant could only

foreshadow.

</p><!-- l. 199 --><p class='indent'>   As the creator and sustainer of all things, seated at God’s right hand (Heb 1:3), Christ is the

sole mediator of salvation. The motif of rest ties directly to this theme, as Christ leads believers

into God’s true rest, surpassing the temporary rest of the Promised Land under Joshua (Heb

4:8–10, referencing Ps 95). Christ’s divine authority ensures a rest surpassing Joshua’s, as His

eternal mediation secures what temporary leaders could not. Covenant fulfilment underscores

Christ’s role as the culmination of Old Testament promises (Heb 1:1–2), as Augustine notes,

“Christ is the end of the law, the prophets, and the patriarchs; in Him all things are

fulfilled”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Augustine1887' title='Augustine1887'><sup class='textsuperscript'>6</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3002f6'></a> 

Access to God’s presence is enabled by His exalted position (Heb 4:16), and perfection

highlights Christ as the pioneer of salvation, made “perfect through suffering” (Heb 2:10,

alluding to Old Testament suffering servant imagery of, e.g., Isa 50:4–9 &amp; 52:13–53:12).

</p><!-- l. 216 --><p class='indent'>   The Book of Hebrews strongly affirms the divinity of Christ, a truth that undergirds his

supremacy over all things. From the outset, the author presents Jesus as the Son of

God, through whom God created the universe and who is “the exact representation

of his being” (Heb 1:2-3). This language identifies the Son as the sustainer of all

things and the one who has purified sins, roles attributed to God himself. Moreover, in

Hebrews 1:8, the author quotes Psalm 45:6-7, where God addresses the Son as “God,”

affirming his divine status and eternal reign. The epistle also emphasises Christ’s

unchanging nature in Hebrews 13:8, stating that “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and

today and forever,” a declaration that aligns with God’s immutability (e.g., Mal

3:6). Ian Mackervoy therefore stresses that Hebrews opens by proclaiming Jesus’

divine name and superior status as the foundation for the letter’s call to persevering

faith.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>7</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3003f7'></a> 

Thus, through these scriptural references and theological assertions, Hebrews unequivocally

establishes Christ’s divinity as central to his supreme authority and salvific work.

</p><!-- l. 237 --><p class='indent'>   Flowing naturally from Christ’s supremacy is the establishment of a new covenant, for His

exalted status not only fulfils the promises of the old but inaugurates a superior covenantal

relationship that renders the former obsolete.

<a id='x1-3004r3'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-new-covenant'><span class='titlemark'>4   </span> <a id='x1-40004'></a>The New Covenant</h3>

<!-- l. 242 --><p class='noindent'>Hebrews contrasts the old covenant, rooted in the Mosaic Law, with the new covenant

established through Christ’s sacrifice. This new covenant is superior, offering forgiveness and

direct access to God (Heb 8:6–13, quoting Jer 31:31–34). John Owen affirms, “The new

covenant, as foretold by Jeremiah and established by Christ, is the perfection of God’s promises,

whereby sins are forgiven, and the law is written on the heart, making the old covenant

obsolete”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Owen1854' title='Owen1854'><sup class='textsuperscript'>8</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4001f8'></a> 

Hebrews 9:15 describes Christ as its mediator, replacing the repetitive sacrifices of the old

system (Lev 16) with His once-for-all atonement. The motif of rest connects here, as the new

covenant enables believers to enter God’s rest through faith (Heb 4:3–5). Covenant fulfilment is

central, as the new covenant completes the Old Testament’s temporary provisions (Heb 8:13).

Access to God’s presence is a hallmark, symbolised by the torn temple veil (Heb 10:19–22,

referencing Old Testament sanctuary imagery). Perfection is achieved through forgiveness,

perfecting believers’ consciences where the old covenant failed (Heb 10:1–4, 14). Ian

Mackervoy likewise stresses that Jesus’ once-for-all sacrifice replaces the repeated

offerings of the old arrangement and secures the better agreement promised in Jeremiah

31.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>9</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4002f9'></a> 

<a id='x1-4003r1'></a>

</p>

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='debates-over-covenant-continuity-and-discontinuity'><span class='titlemark'>4.1   </span> <a id='x1-50001'></a>Debates over Covenant Continuity and Discontinuity</h4>

<!-- l. 265 --><p class='noindent'>The portrayal of the new covenant in Hebrews has sparked significant scholarly debate

regarding its relationship to the old covenant. This debate, which centres on the extent of

continuity and discontinuity between the two covenants, is crucial for understanding how

Hebrews presents the new covenant as superior and how this superiority relates to the epistle’s

broader themes and motifs. While the previous section established the new covenant’s role in

offering forgiveness and direct access to God, the question remains: does this new covenant

represent a radical break from the old, or does it fulfil and perfect what the old covenant

foreshadowed?

</p><!-- l. 276 --><p class='indent'>   Hebrews itself provides seemingly contrasting signals. On one hand, Hebrews 8:13

declares that “by calling this covenant ‘new,’ he has made the first one obsolete; and

what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear,” suggesting a sharp discontinuity.

This perspective is echoed by Ian Mackervoy, who highlights that Hebrews 8:13

declares the first agreement “out of date” and ready to disappear, signalling the

displacement of the Mosaic system in light of Christ’s superior priesthood and

sacrifice.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>10</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5001f10'></a> 

Such a view underscores the radical nature of Christ’s work, rendering the old covenant’s

sacrificial system entirely obsolete and emphasising the urgency of embracing the new covenant

fully. This interpretation aligns with Hebrews’ stark warnings against reverting to the old

system (e.g., Hebrews 10:26–31), as doing so would mean rejecting the only sufficient means of

atonement.

</p><!-- l. 294 --><p class='indent'>   On the other hand, Hebrews also portrays the new covenant as the fulfilment of promises

embedded in the old covenant, suggesting a deep continuity. Ian Mackervoy notes that the quotation

of Jeremiah 31 in Hebrews 8:8–12 shows God writing his law on hearts and empowering obedience,

so that the new agreement realises what the first only foreshadowed rather than discarding Israel’s

story.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>11</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5002f11'></a> 

This motif of fulfilment is further evident in Hebrews 10:1, where the law is described as

“only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves.”

Thus, the new covenant does not abolish the old arbitrarily but brings its sacrificial,

priestly, and prophetic elements to their intended completion in Christ. John Calvin

captures this dual perspective, stating, “The old covenant was not contrary to the

gospel, but was its cradle; in Christ, the shadows are removed and the truth shines

forth”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Calvin1853' title='Calvin1853'><sup class='textsuperscript'>12</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5003f12'></a> 

</p><!-- l. 309 --><p class='indent'>   This scholarly debate is not merely academic; it profoundly shapes how we understand the

epistle’s dominant themes and intersecting motifs. If the new covenant is seen as a sharp

discontinuity, it highlights the transformative nature of Christ’s work and the obsolescence of

the old system, reinforcing the theme of Christ’s supremacy and the peril of rejecting His

sufficient atonement, and intensifies warnings like Hebrews 6:4-6, where rejecting

Christ leaves no alternative atonement. This perspective also sharpens the motif of

rest, as entry into God’s rest becomes exclusively tied to faith in Christ rather than

adherence to the old covenant’s practices. Conversely, viewing the new covenant as a

deep continuity enriches our understanding of motifs like covenant fulfilment and

perfection. It shows how the old covenant’s temporary provisions—such as the Levitical

priesthood and repeated sacrifices—find their substance and completion in Christ’s

eternal priesthood and once-for-all sacrifice. This fulfilment motif underscores that

Christ does not discard the old covenant but perfects it, achieving what it could only

foreshadow.

</p><!-- l. 332 --><p class='indent'>   Moreover, the way one interprets the relationship between the covenants influences how

believers understand their identity and practice under the new covenant. A discontinuity view

might lead to a greater emphasis on the distinctiveness of Christian worship and ethics, free

from the old covenant’s rituals. In contrast, a continuity view could encourage believers to see

their faith as the true realisation of Old Testament worship, with Christ as the ultimate High

Priest and sacrifice. This perspective deepens the call to holiness and worship (Heb 12:14,

28), as believers are invited to live in grateful response to the fulfilled promises of

God.

</p><!-- l. 342 --><p class='indent'>   Ultimately, while Hebrews clearly presents the new covenant as superior and the old as

obsolete, the epistle also weaves a narrative of fulfilment that honours the old covenant’s role in

God’s redemptive plan. This nuanced interplay between continuity and discontinuity

enriches our understanding of the epistle’s themes, particularly the supremacy of

Christ and the perfection He achieves for believers. It also reinforces the urgency of

the warning against rejecting Christ’s atonement, as to spurn the fulfilled covenant

is to forfeit the very rest, access, and perfection that the old covenant could never

provide.

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-priesthood-of-christ'><span class='titlemark'>5   </span> <a id='x1-60005'></a>The Priesthood of Christ</h3>

<!-- l. 354 --><p class='noindent'>Christ’s role as the eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek, surpassing the Levitical

priesthood, is a dominant theme. Hebrews 7:23–28, referencing Ps 110:4, highlights His eternal

priesthood, with His single sacrifice perfecting believers forever (Heb 10:11–14). Ian Mackervoy

explains that Hebrews invokes Melchizedek to show how Jesus’ kingly and priestly vocation,

undergirded by his own shed blood, secures an eternal redemption that surpasses the Levitical

order.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>13</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6001f13'></a> 

This priesthood grants access to God’s presence (Heb 4:14–16), central to the motif of rest, as

the <span class='ec-lmri-12'>sabbatismos </span>of Heb 4:9–10 reflects God’s Sabbath rest, shared through Christ’s priestly

work (Gen 2:2).

</p><!-- l. 370 --><p class='indent'>   Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315–386) discusses how Christ’s divine-human nature is tied

to his eternal priesthood. In his Catechetical Lectures he explains that Jesus was

“eternally anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood on behalf of men”, meaning

that Christ’s role as High Priest comes directly from God and is set for all eternity.

Cyril goes on to emphasise that Christ “is a High Priest, whose priesthood passes

not to another”, underscoring that Jesus alone offers the once-for-all sacrifice for

sin.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Cyril1894' title='Cyril1894'><sup class='textsuperscript'>14</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6002f14'></a> 

This echoes the book of Hebrews: as our perfect God-man High Priest, Christ has entered the

heavenly sanctuary to intercede for us and grant us direct access to God, accomplishing what

the old priestly sacrifices could only foreshadow (cf. Heb 4:14–16).

</p><!-- l. 385 --><p class='indent'>   Covenant fulfilment is evident, as Christ’s priesthood completes the Aaronic system

(Heb 7:11–22). Access to God’s presence is secured by His mediation (Heb 10:19),

and perfection is achieved, as His priesthood makes believers complete (Heb 7:19,

28).

<a id='x1-6003r6'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='faith-and-perseverance'><span class='titlemark'>6   </span> <a id='x1-70006'></a>Faith and Perseverance</h3>

<!-- l. 390 --><p class='noindent'>Hebrews emphasises faith and perseverance, particularly in trials. Chapter 11 recounts

Old Testament figures who, despite significant failures and moral shortcomings,

exemplified enduring faith, encouraging believers to persevere (Heb 10:19–39).

Ian Mackervoy observes that Hebrews 11 showcases people who trusted God’s

promises even when fulfilment lay ahead, modelling the persevering faith the letter

commends.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>15</sup></a></span><a id='x1-7001f15'></a> 

The motif of rest is linked, as Heb 3:12–19, citing Ps 95, warns that unbelief prevents entry into

God’s rest, while Heb 4:2–3 assures that faith secures it. Abraham’s faith (Heb 11:8–10)

anticipates the rest fulfilled in Christ (Heb 4:9), illustrating perseverance toward God’s promise.

Abraham’s faith amid uncertainty (Heb 11:8) models perseverance for believers facing

persecution. John Wesley adds, “The faith of the patriarchs, as recounted in Hebrews, is our

example to persevere in trusting Christ, for without faith it is impossible to please

God”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Wesley1755' title='Wesley1755'><sup class='textsuperscript'>16</sup></a></span><a id='x1-7002f16'></a> 

Covenant fulfilment connects, as faith in Christ’s work secures Old Testament promises (Heb

11:39–40). Access to God’s presence is accessed through faith (Heb 4:16), and perseverance

ensures continued access (Heb 10:22). Perfection is received by faith, as believers await

completion through Christ (Heb 11:40).

<a id='x1-7003r7'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-call-to-holiness-and-worship'><span class='titlemark'>7   </span> <a id='x1-80007'></a>The Call to Holiness and Worship</h3>

<!-- l. 423 --><p class='noindent'>Hebrews urges believers to embrace holiness and worship as vital responses to Christ’s

redemptive work. Hebrews 12:14 exhorts, “be holy; without holiness no one will see

the Lord,” while Hebrews 12:28-29 calls for worship “with reverence and awe.”

These commands are not mere ideals but practical expressions of faith. Jonathan

Edwards captures this, noting, “True holiness, as urged in Hebrews, is the fruit of

faith in Christ’s redemption, whereby we live to God’s glory and worship Him in

reverence”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Edwards1959' title='Edwards1959'><sup class='textsuperscript'>17</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8001f17'></a> 

</p><!-- l. 435 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='ec-lmri-12'>Holiness </span>entails ethical living, compassion, and peacemaking. Practically, believers can

reflect this by making honest choices at work, showing kindness to the marginalised, or

mediating disputes with grace (Heb 12:14). This flows from Christ’s sanctifying sacrifice

(Heb 10:14). Holiness reflects the perfection Christ imparts (Heb 10:14), aligning

believers with their completed status. Ian Mackervoy underscores its urgency, noting that

Hebrews 12:14 calls believers to belong wholly to God because only the holy will see the

Lord.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>18</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8002f18'></a> 

Without it, we cannot fully enter God’s presence.

</p><!-- l. 452 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='ec-lmri-12'>Worship</span>, meanwhile, transcends rituals, permeating daily life through gratitude, service, and

awe. Simple acts—thanking God for a meal, serving a neighbour, or marvelling at a

sunset—become offerings of praise (Heb 13:15-16). Engaging Scripture or creation deepens

reverence (Heb 12:28).

</p><!-- l. 460 --><p class='indent'>   These practices interweave with Hebrews’ motifs: holiness and worship bring rest (Heb 4:9),

fulfil the new covenant (Heb 8:10-12), grant access to God (Heb 12:14), and reflect Christ’s

perfection (Heb 10:14). Yet, they stem from grace, not obligation (Heb 10:10). Edwards and

Mackervoy affirm that holiness and worship, rooted in Christ’s sufficiency, transform believers’

lives, fostering peace, integrity, and intimacy with God. But failing to recognise that holiness

and acts of worship stem from grace and are rooted in Christ’s sufficiency, and thinking that

they somehow help towards our redemption, is, in fact, rejecting the sufficiency of Christ’s

atonement.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='warning-against-rejecting-christs-sufficient-atonement'><span class='titlemark'>8   </span> <a id='x1-90008'></a>Warning Against Rejecting Christ’s Sufficient Atonement</h3>

<!-- l. 477 --><p class='noindent'>The warning against failing to accept Christ’s atoning work as sufficient, particularly by turning

to human works or the Levitical system, is critical. Although these warnings were addressed to

Jewish Christians tempted to revert to Judaism, the concept of working towards salvation, thus

rejecting Christ’s sufficiency, is universal for all Christians.

</p><!-- l. 485 --><p class='indent'>   Hebrews 10:1–4, referencing Leviticus, explains that old covenant sacrifices were shadows, while

Christ’s sacrifice is definitive (Heb 10:10–14). John Calvin warns, “To reject Christ’s sacrifice is

to trample underfoot the blood of the covenant, for there remains no other sacrifice for

sins”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Calvin1853' title='Calvin1853'><sup class='textsuperscript'>19</sup></a></span><a id='x1-9001f19'></a> 

Rejecting this truth risks peril (Heb 6:4–6, 10:26–31). Ian Mackervoy adds that

those who turn back after knowing the truth “refuse the one way that God

has given,” and therefore face the fearful judgement that falls on Christ’s

enemies.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>20</sup></a></span><a id='x1-9002f20'></a> 

A stark warning is proffered: unbelief or syncretism bars entry into God’s rest (Heb 3:7–19,

4:1–11). Covenant fulfilment underscores the danger, as rejecting Christ’s sacrifice negates the

fulfilled covenant (Heb 10:29). Access to God’s presence is jeopardised by reverting to works

(Heb 10:19–22), and perfection is forfeited by rejecting Christ’s sacrifice (Heb 10:26–31).

Today, this warning applies to reliance on moralism, echoing the legalism Hebrews

rejects.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-motifs-as-unifying-threads'><span class='titlemark'>9   </span> <a id='x1-100009'></a>The Motifs as Unifying Threads</h3>

<!-- l. 510 --><p class='noindent'>The motifs of rest, covenant fulfilment, access to God’s presence, and perfection unify the six themes,

each illuminating a facet of Christ’s work. Ian Mackervoy explains that the promised rest points to

a future of peace and blessing opened by Christ, fulfilling what the wilderness generation only

glimpsed.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>21</sup></a></span><a id='x1-10001f21'></a> 

John Owen adds, “Christ’s priesthood and sacrifice grant access to

God’s presence, fulfilling the old covenant’s shadows and perfecting

believers”<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Owen1854' title='Owen1854'><sup class='textsuperscript'>22</sup></a></span><a id='x1-10002f22'></a> :

      <ul class='itemize1'>

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Rest</strong> (<span class='ec-lmri-12'>katapausis </span>and <span class='ec-lmri-12'>sabbatismos</span>, Heb 4:9) symbolises salvation’s goal, entered

      through  Christ’s  supremacy,  the  new  covenant,  and  priesthood,  dependent  on

      faith, exhibited in holiness, and jeopardised by unbelief, framed by Old Testament

      references (e.g., Ps 95).

      </li>

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Covenant fulfilment</strong> highlights Christ’s completion of Old Testament promises,

      surpassing the old covenant through His supremacy, priesthood, and new covenant,

      requiring faith and inspiring holiness, with warnings against rejecting the fulfilled

      covenant (e.g., Jer 31).

      </li>

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Access to God’s presence</strong> emphasises salvation’s relational aspect, enabled by

      Christ’s mediation, secured through the new covenant and priesthood, accessed by

      faith, expressed in holiness, and lost through syncretism, rooted in Old Testament

      sanctuary imagery.

      </li>

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Perfection</strong> underscores salvation’s completion, achieved by Christ’s supremacy,

      priesthood,  and  new  covenant,  received  through  faith,  reflected  in  holiness,

      and forfeited by rejecting His atonement, contrasting with the Old Testament’s

      ineffective sacrifices.</li></ul>

<!-- l. 545 --><p class='noindent'>Rest is experiential, symbolising salvation’s goal; covenant fulfilment is theological, focusing on Old

Testament fulfilment; access to God’s presence is relational, emphasising intimacy; and

perfection is soteriological, highlighting completion. These motifs, grounded in the Old

Testament, create a cohesive narrative exalting Christ.

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='conclusion'><span class='titlemark'>10   </span> <a id='x1-1100010'></a>Conclusion</h3>

<!-- l. 552 --><p class='noindent'>The Book of Hebrews weaves a rich theological tapestry grounded in Old Testament imagery

and fulfilled in Christ. Its core themes—Christ’s supremacy, the new covenant, His eternal

priesthood, faith and perseverance, the call to holiness and worship, and the warning against

rejecting His atonement—together present a sustained argument for the sufficiency of Christ’s

work and the necessity of enduring faith. Interwoven throughout are the motifs of rest, covenant

fulfilment, access to God’s presence, and perfection, each deepening the epistle’s message and

unifying its structure.

</p><!-- l. 565 --><p class='indent'>   Crucially, Hebrews presents not merely a rejection of the old covenant but a transformative

fulfilment of it. While certain elements—such as the Levitical priesthood and repeated

sacrifices—are rendered obsolete in light of Christ’s once-for-all atonement (Heb 10:1–14), the

theological arc of Scripture is not broken but brought to maturity. The new covenant does not

abolish God’s former dealings but reveals their intended goal in Christ (Heb 8:6–13, 10:1). This

dual movement—both discontinuity and continuity—invites readers to interpret Scripture not as

static law but as dynamic promise, fulfilled through the incarnate Son and now mediated to

believers through faith.

</p><!-- l. 577 --><p class='indent'>   Theologically, this calls readers to embrace Christ as the exclusive and sufficient means of

access to God, cautioning against any return to performance-based righteousness or religious

syncretism. Practically, Hebrews exhorts believers to perseverance in trials, confident access to

God’s presence (Heb 4:16), reverent holiness (Heb 12:14, 28), and deep trust in the promises yet

to be fully seen (Heb 11:1). The motifs function not only as literary devices but as discipleship

tools, guiding believers into experiential rest, covenantal identity, relational intimacy, and the

hope of perfected salvation.

</p><!-- l. 587 --><p class='indent'>   Ultimately, Hebrews compels a response: to trust fully in the sufficiency of Christ’s finished

work, to live in gratitude for God’s fulfilled promises, and to await, with patient perseverance,

the final consummation of the salvation already secured.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='introduction'><span class='titlemark'>1   </span> <a id='x1-10001'></a>Introduction</h3>

<!-- l. 113 --><p class='noindent'>The Book of Hebrews, a profound epistle in the New Testament, is a theological masterpiece

crafted to encourage early Jewish Christians to remain steadfast in their faith in Yeshua the

Messiah amidst pressures to revert to Judaism. After discussing the book’s Old Testament

foundation, this essay explores the six most dominant themes in Hebrews—namely, the

supremacy of the Messiah, the new covenant, the priesthood of the Messiah, faith and

perseverance, the call to holiness and worship, and the critical warning against failing to trust

fully in the Messiah’s sufficient atonement. It also examines how the motifs of rest, covenant

fulfilment, access to God’s presence, and perfection interweave these themes, serving as unifying

threads that underscore the book’s message of salvation through faith in the Messiah

alone.

</p><!-- l. 125 --><p class='indent'>   This essay argues that Hebrews employs its themes and motifs to exhort believers to trust

fully in the Messiah’s finished work, fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament.

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='reliance-on-the-old-testament'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> <a id='x1-20002'></a>Reliance on the Old Testament</h3>

<!-- l. 129 --><p class='noindent'>The Book of Hebrews heavily relies on the Old Testament to construct its theological

arguments, grounding its claims about the Messiah in the scriptures familiar to its

Jewish Christian audience. As John Calvin observes in his argument introducing the

epistle, Hebrews demonstrates how the figures and shadows of the Law find their

fulfilment in the Messiah, and how the promises given to the fathers are accomplished in

Him”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Calvin1853' title='Calvin1853'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2001f1'></a> 

Ian Mackervoy similarly observes that the epistle “argues from the Old Testament to keep [its

readers] trusting in Christ,” weaving quotations and exposition into a pastoral appeal for

perseverance.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>2</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2002f2'></a> 

Hebrews includes direct quotations from the Septuagint, drawn from texts like the Psalms,

Jeremiah, and Leviticus (e.g., Ps 95 in Heb 3:7–11; Jer 31:31–34 in Heb 8:8–12). These

quotations, often introduced with phrases like “as it is written” or “the Holy Spirit says,”

emphasise their authoritative role. Beyond direct quotes, Hebrews frequently alludes to Old

Testament figures (e.g., Melchizedek in Heb 7; Moses in Heb 3) and events (e.g., the wilderness

wandering in Heb 3–4), using them as types or shadows fulfilled in the Messiah. Indirect

references permeate the book’s discussions of the Law, sacrifices, and priesthood, which assume

familiarity with Old Testament institutions (e.g., Lev 16 in Heb 9). This grounding in familiar

scriptures bolstered the author’s appeal to Jewish Christians facing temptation to

either abandon the Messiah, or to see the Messiah as an addition to the Levitical

ordinances.

</p><!-- l. 159 --><p class='indent'>   In terms of sheer volume, Dana M. Harris collates tallies that range

from thirty-two to thirty-seven explicit quotations of the Old Testament

alongside dozens of allusions, underlining how saturated the sermon is with

Scripture.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Harris2021' title='Harris2021'><sup class='textsuperscript'>3</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2003f3'></a>  She

therefore concludes that “the prevalence of the Old Testament is one of the most striking features of the Epistle

to the Hebrews”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Harris2021' title='Harris2021'><sup class='textsuperscript'>4</sup></a></span><a id='x1-2004f4'></a> 

</p><!-- l. 167 --><p class='indent'>   This pervasive Old Testament engagement anchors Hebrews’ argument that the Messiah

fulfills and surpasses the old covenant, making the Old Testament indispensable to its

message.

<a id='x1-2005r2'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-supremacy-of-the-messiah'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> <a id='x1-30003'></a>The Supremacy of The Messiah</h3>

<!-- l. 171 --><p class='noindent'>At the heart of Hebrews lies the theme of the Messiah’s supremacy, portraying Him as superior

to all figures and institutions of the Old Testament. Hebrews 1:1–4 establishes Yeshua as the eternal

Son of God, the ultimate revelation who surpasses angels, Moses, and the Levitical priesthood,

fulfilling Old Testament prophecies (e.g., Ps 2:7; 2 Sam 7:14). Jonathan Edwards, preaching on

the Messiah’s infinite greatness, declared that our Saviour “is infinitely great and high above

all… He is higher than the highest angels of heaven… angels themselves are as nothing before

him.”<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Edwards1981' title='Edwards1981'><sup class='textsuperscript'>5</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3001f5'></a> 

As the Creator and Sustainer of all things (Heb 1:3), the Messiah therefore alone reigns at the

Father’s right hand as the supreme Mediator. In short, “[the Messiah] has received a more

excellent name than Moses” and a priesthood “after the order of Melchizedek” that far

surpasses Aaron’s (Heb 3:3; 7:17). The Messiah’s glory and authority are thus presented

throughout Hebrews 1–4 as utterly beyond any angel or human minister, securing full access

to God’s presence and the completeness of salvation. The Messiah’s supremacy, as

the eternal Son and High Priest, not only fulfils the Old Testament promises of a

Messiah but also secures for believers the ultimate rest that the old covenant could only

foreshadow.

</p><!-- l. 199 --><p class='indent'>   As the creator and sustainer of all things, seated at God’s right hand (Heb 1:3), the Messiah

is the sole mediator of salvation. The motif of rest ties directly to this theme, as

the Messiah leads believers into God’s true rest, surpassing the temporary rest of

the Promised Land under Joshua (Heb 4:8–10, referencing Ps 95). The Messiah’s

divine authority ensures a rest surpassing Joshua’s, as His eternal mediation secures

what temporary leaders could not. Covenant fulfilment underscores the Messiah’s

role as the culmination of Old Testament promises (Heb 1:1–2), as Augustine notes,

“Christ is the end of the law, the prophets, and the patriarchs; in Him all things are

fulfilled”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Augustine1887' title='Augustine1887'><sup class='textsuperscript'>6</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3002f6'></a> 

Access to God’s presence is enabled by His exalted position (Heb 4:16), and perfection

highlights the Messiah as the pioneer of salvation, made “perfect through suffering”

(Heb 2:10, alluding to Old Testament suffering servant imagery of, e.g., Isa 50:4–9 &amp;

52:13–53:12).

</p><!-- l. 216 --><p class='indent'>   The Book of Hebrews strongly affirms the divinity of the Messiah, a truth that undergirds

his supremacy over all things. From the outset, the author presents Yeshua as the Son of God,

through whom God created the universe and who is “the exact representation of his being”

(Heb 1:2-3). This language identifies the Son as the sustainer of all things and the one

who has purified sins, roles attributed to God himself. Moreover, in Hebrews 1:8, the

author quotes Psalm 45:6-7, where God addresses the Son as “God,” affirming his

divine status and eternal reign. The epistle also emphasises the Messiah’s unchanging

nature in Hebrews 13:8, stating that “Yeshua the Messiah is the same yesterday and

today and forever,” a declaration that aligns with God’s immutability (e.g., Mal

3:6). Ian Mackervoy therefore stresses that Hebrews opens by proclaiming Jesus’

divine name and superior status as the foundation for the letter’s call to persevering

faith.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>7</sup></a></span><a id='x1-3003f7'></a> 

Thus, through these scriptural references and theological assertions, Hebrews unequivocally

establishes the Messiah’s divinity as central to his supreme authority and salvific

work.

</p><!-- l. 237 --><p class='indent'>   Flowing naturally from the Messiah’s supremacy is the establishment of a new covenant, for

His exalted status not only fulfils the promises of the old but inaugurates a superior covenantal

relationship that renders the former obsolete.

<a id='x1-3004r3'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-new-covenant'><span class='titlemark'>4   </span> <a id='x1-40004'></a>The New Covenant</h3>

<!-- l. 242 --><p class='noindent'>Hebrews contrasts the old covenant, rooted in the Mosaic Law, with the new covenant established

through the Messiah’s sacrifice. This new covenant is superior, offering forgiveness and direct

access to God (Heb 8:6–13, quoting Jer 31:31–34). John Owen affirms, “The new covenant, as

foretold by Jeremiah and established by the Messiah, is the perfection of God’s promises,

whereby sins are forgiven, and the law is written on the heart, making the old covenant

obsolete”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Owen1854' title='Owen1854'><sup class='textsuperscript'>8</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4001f8'></a> 

Hebrews 9:15 describes the Messiah as its mediator, replacing the repetitive sacrifices of the old

system (Lev 16) with His once-for-all atonement. The motif of rest connects here, as the new

covenant enables believers to enter God’s rest through faith (Heb 4:3–5). Covenant fulfilment is

central, as the new covenant completes the Old Testament’s temporary provisions (Heb 8:13).

Access to God’s presence is a hallmark, symbolised by the torn temple veil (Heb 10:19–22,

referencing Old Testament sanctuary imagery). Perfection is achieved through forgiveness,

perfecting believers’ consciences where the old covenant failed (Heb 10:1–4, 14). Ian

Mackervoy likewise stresses that Jesus’ once-for-all sacrifice replaces the repeated

offerings of the old arrangement and secures the better agreement promised in Jeremiah

31.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>9</sup></a></span><a id='x1-4002f9'></a>

</p>

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='debates-over-covenant-continuity-and-discontinuity'><span class='titlemark'>4.1   </span> <a id='x1-50001'></a>Debates over Covenant Continuity and Discontinuity</h4>

<!-- l. 265 --><p class='noindent'>The portrayal of the new covenant in Hebrews has sparked significant scholarly debate

regarding its relationship to the old covenant. This debate, which centres on the extent of

continuity and discontinuity between the two covenants, is crucial for understanding how

Hebrews presents the new covenant as superior and how this superiority relates to the epistle’s

broader themes and motifs. While the previous section established the new covenant’s role in

offering forgiveness and direct access to God, the question remains: does this new covenant

represent a radical break from the old, or does it fulfil and perfect what the old covenant

foreshadowed?

</p><!-- l. 276 --><p class='indent'>   Hebrews itself provides seemingly contrasting signals. On one hand, Hebrews 8:13

declares that “by calling this covenant ‘new,’ he has made the first one obsolete; and

what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear,” suggesting a sharp discontinuity.

This perspective is echoed by Ian Mackervoy, who highlights that Hebrews 8:13

declares the first agreement “out of date” and ready to disappear, signalling the

displacement of the Mosaic system in light of the Messiah’s superior priesthood and

sacrifice.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>10</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5001f10'></a> 

Such a view underscores the radical nature of the Messiah’s work, rendering the old covenant’s

sacrificial system entirely obsolete and emphasising the urgency of embracing the new covenant

fully. This interpretation aligns with Hebrews’ stark warnings against reverting to the old

system (e.g., Hebrews 10:26–31), as doing so would mean rejecting the only sufficient means of

atonement.

</p><!-- l. 294 --><p class='indent'>   On the other hand, Hebrews also portrays the new covenant as the fulfilment of promises

embedded in the old covenant, suggesting a deep continuity. Ian Mackervoy notes that the quotation

of Jeremiah 31 in Hebrews 8:8–12 shows God writing his law on hearts and empowering obedience,

so that the new agreement realises what the first only foreshadowed rather than discarding Israel’s

story.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>11</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5002f11'></a> 

This motif of fulfilment is further evident in Hebrews 10:1, where the law is described as “only a

shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves.” Thus, the new

covenant does not abolish the old arbitrarily but brings its sacrificial, priestly, and

prophetic elements to their intended completion in the Messiah. John Calvin captures

this dual perspective, stating, “The old covenant was not contrary to the gospel,

but was its cradle; in the Messiah, the shadows are removed and the truth shines

forth”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Calvin1853' title='Calvin1853'><sup class='textsuperscript'>12</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5003f12'></a> 

</p><!-- l. 309 --><p class='indent'>   This scholarly debate is not merely academic; it profoundly shapes how we understand the

epistle’s dominant themes and intersecting motifs. If the new covenant is seen as a sharp

discontinuity, it highlights the transformative nature of the Messiah’s work and the obsolescence

of the old system, reinforcing the theme of the Messiah’s supremacy and the peril of rejecting

His sufficient atonement, and intensifies warnings like Hebrews 6:4-6, where rejecting the

Messiah leaves no alternative atonement. This perspective also sharpens the motif of rest, as

entry into God’s rest becomes exclusively tied to faith in the Messiah rather than

adherence to the old covenant’s practices. Conversely, viewing the new covenant as a

deep continuity enriches our understanding of motifs like covenant fulfilment and

perfection. It shows how the old covenant’s temporary provisions—such as the Levitical

priesthood and repeated sacrifices—find their substance and completion in the Messiah’s

eternal priesthood and once-for-all sacrifice. This fulfilment motif underscores that the

Messiah does not discard the old covenant but perfects it, achieving what it could only

foreshadow.

</p><!-- l. 332 --><p class='indent'>   Moreover, the way one interprets the relationship between the covenants influences how

believers understand their identity and practice under the new covenant. A discontinuity view

might lead to a greater emphasis on the distinctiveness of Christian worship and ethics, free

from the old covenant’s rituals. In contrast, a continuity view could encourage believers to see

their faith as the true realisation of Old Testament worship, with the Messiah as the ultimate

High Priest and sacrifice. This perspective deepens the call to holiness and worship (Heb 12:14,

28), as believers are invited to live in grateful response to the fulfilled promises of

God.

</p><!-- l. 342 --><p class='indent'>   Ultimately, while Hebrews clearly presents the new covenant as superior and the old as

obsolete, the epistle also weaves a narrative of fulfilment that honours the old covenant’s role in

God’s redemptive plan. This nuanced interplay between continuity and discontinuity enriches

our understanding of the epistle’s themes, particularly the supremacy of the Messiah

and the perfection He achieves for believers. It also reinforces the urgency of the

warning against rejecting the Messiah’s atonement, as to spurn the fulfilled covenant

is to forfeit the very rest, access, and perfection that the old covenant could never

provide.

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-priesthood-of-the-messiah'><span class='titlemark'>5   </span> <a id='x1-60005'></a>The Priesthood of The Messiah</h3>

<!-- l. 354 --><p class='noindent'>The Messiah’s role as the eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek, surpassing the Levitical

priesthood, is a dominant theme. Hebrews 7:23–28, referencing Ps 110:4, highlights His eternal

priesthood, with His single sacrifice perfecting believers forever (Heb 10:11–14). Ian Mackervoy

explains that Hebrews invokes Melchizedek to show how Jesus’ kingly and priestly vocation,

undergirded by his own shed blood, secures an eternal redemption that surpasses the Levitical

order.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>13</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6001f13'></a> 

This priesthood grants access to God’s presence (Heb 4:14–16), central to the motif of rest, as

the <span class='ec-lmri-12'>sabbatismos </span>of Heb 4:9–10 reflects God’s Sabbath rest, shared through the Messiah’s

priestly work (Gen 2:2).

</p><!-- l. 370 --><p class='indent'>   Cyril of Jerusalem (c. 315–386) discusses how the Messiah’s divine-human nature is tied to

his eternal priesthood. In his Catechetical Lectures he explains that Yeshua was “eternally

anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood on behalf of men”, meaning that the

Messiah’s role as High Priest comes directly from God and is set for all eternity. Cyril

goes on to emphasise that the Messiah “is a High Priest, whose priesthood passes

not to another”, underscoring that Yeshua alone offers the once-for-all sacrifice for

sin.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Cyril1894' title='Cyril1894'><sup class='textsuperscript'>14</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6002f14'></a> 

This echoes the book of Hebrews: as our perfect God-man High Priest, the Messiah

has entered the heavenly sanctuary to intercede for us and grant us direct access to

God, accomplishing what the old priestly sacrifices could only foreshadow (cf. Heb

4:14–16).

</p><!-- l. 385 --><p class='indent'>   Covenant fulfilment is evident, as the Messiah’s priesthood completes the Aaronic system

(Heb 7:11–22). Access to God’s presence is secured by His mediation (Heb 10:19),

and perfection is achieved, as His priesthood makes believers complete (Heb 7:19,

28).

<a id='x1-6003r6'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='faith-and-perseverance'><span class='titlemark'>6   </span> <a id='x1-70006'></a>Faith and Perseverance</h3>

<!-- l. 390 --><p class='noindent'>Hebrews emphasises faith and perseverance, particularly in trials. Chapter 11 recounts

Old Testament figures who, despite significant failures and moral shortcomings,

exemplified enduring faith, encouraging believers to persevere (Heb 10:19–39).

Ian Mackervoy observes that Hebrews 11 showcases people who trusted God’s

promises even when fulfilment lay ahead, modelling the persevering faith the letter

commends.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>15</sup></a></span><a id='x1-7001f15'></a> 

The motif of rest is linked, as Heb 3:12–19, citing Ps 95, warns that unbelief prevents entry into

God’s rest, while Heb 4:2–3 assures that faith secures it. Abraham’s faith (Heb 11:8–10)

anticipates the rest fulfilled in the Messiah (Heb 4:9), illustrating perseverance toward God’s

promise. Abraham’s faith amid uncertainty (Heb 11:8) models perseverance for believers facing

persecution. John Wesley adds, “The faith of the patriarchs, as recounted in Hebrews, is our

example to persevere in trusting Christ, for without faith it is impossible to please

God”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Wesley1755' title='Wesley1755'><sup class='textsuperscript'>16</sup></a></span><a id='x1-7002f16'></a> 

Covenant fulfilment connects, as faith in the Messiah’s work secures Old Testament promises

(Heb 11:39–40). Access to God’s presence is accessed through faith (Heb 4:16), and

perseverance ensures continued access (Heb 10:22). Perfection is received by faith, as believers

await completion through the Messiah (Heb 11:40).

<a id='x1-7003r7'></a>

</p>

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='the-call-to-holiness-and-worship'><span class='titlemark'>7   </span> <a id='x1-80007'></a>The Call to Holiness and Worship</h3>

<!-- l. 423 --><p class='noindent'>Hebrews urges believers to embrace holiness and worship as vital responses to the

Messiah’s redemptive work. Hebrews 12:14 exhorts, “be holy; without holiness no one will

see the Lord,” while Hebrews 12:28-29 calls for worship “with reverence and awe.”

These commands are not mere ideals but practical expressions of faith. Jonathan

Edwards captures this, noting, “True holiness, as urged in Hebrews, is the fruit of

faith in Christ’s redemption, whereby we live to God’s glory and worship Him in

reverence”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Edwards1959' title='Edwards1959'><sup class='textsuperscript'>17</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8001f17'></a> 

</p><!-- l. 435 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='ec-lmri-12'>Holiness </span>entails ethical living, compassion, and peacemaking. Practically, believers can

reflect this by making honest choices at work, showing kindness to the marginalised, or

mediating disputes with grace (Heb 12:14). This flows from the Messiah’s sanctifying sacrifice

(Heb 10:14). Holiness reflects the perfection the Messiah imparts (Heb 10:14), aligning

believers with their completed status. Ian Mackervoy underscores its urgency, noting that

Hebrews 12:14 calls believers to belong wholly to God because only the holy will see the

Lord.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>18</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8002f18'></a> 

Without it, we cannot fully enter God’s presence.

</p><!-- l. 452 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='ec-lmri-12'>Worship</span>, meanwhile, transcends rituals, permeating daily life through gratitude, service, and

awe. Simple acts—thanking God for a meal, serving a neighbour, or marvelling at a

sunset—become offerings of praise (Heb 13:15-16). Engaging Scripture or creation deepens

reverence (Heb 12:28).

</p><!-- l. 460 --><p class='indent'>   These practices interweave with Hebrews’ motifs: holiness and worship bring rest (Heb

4:9), fulfil the new covenant (Heb 8:10-12), grant access to God (Heb 12:14), and

reflect the Messiah’s perfection (Heb 10:14). Yet, they stem from grace, not obligation

(Heb 10:10). Edwards and Mackervoy affirm that holiness and worship, rooted in

the Messiah’s sufficiency, transform believers’ lives, fostering peace, integrity, and

intimacy with God. But failing to recognise that holiness and acts of worship stem from

grace and are rooted in the Messiah’s sufficiency, and thinking that they somehow

help towards our redemption, is, in fact, rejecting the sufficiency of the Messiah’s

atonement.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='warning-against-rejecting-the-messiahs-sufficient-atonement'><span class='titlemark'>8   </span> <a id='x1-90008'></a>Warning Against Rejecting The Messiah’s Sufficient Atonement</h3>

<!-- l. 477 --><p class='noindent'>The warning against failing to accept the Messiah’s atoning work as sufficient, particularly by

turning to human works or the Levitical system, is critical. Although these warnings

were addressed to Jewish Christians tempted to revert to Judaism, the concept of

working towards salvation, thus rejecting the Messiah’s sufficiency, is universal for all

Christians.

</p><!-- l. 485 --><p class='indent'>   Hebrews 10:1–4, referencing Leviticus, explains that old covenant sacrifices were shadows,

while the Messiah’s sacrifice is definitive (Heb 10:10–14). John Calvin warns, “To reject Christ’s

sacrifice is to trample underfoot the blood of the covenant, for there remains no other sacrifice for

sins”.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#Calvin1853' title='Calvin1853'><sup class='textsuperscript'>19</sup></a></span><a id='x1-9001f19'></a> 

Rejecting this truth risks peril (Heb 6:4–6, 10:26–31). Ian Mackervoy adds that

those who turn back after knowing the truth “refuse the one way that God

has given,” and therefore face the fearful judgement that falls on Christ’s

enemies.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>20</sup></a></span><a id='x1-9002f20'></a> 

A stark warning is proffered: unbelief or syncretism bars entry into God’s rest (Heb 3:7–19,

4:1–11). Covenant fulfilment underscores the danger, as rejecting the Messiah’s sacrifice negates

the fulfilled covenant (Heb 10:29). Access to God’s presence is jeopardised by reverting to works

(Heb 10:19–22), and perfection is forfeited by rejecting the Messiah’s sacrifice (Heb 10:26–31).

Today, this warning applies to reliance on moralism, echoing the legalism Hebrews

rejects.

<!-- l. 510 --><p class='noindent'>The motifs of rest, covenant fulfilment, access to God’s presence, and perfection unify the six themes,

each illuminating a facet of the Messiah’s work. Ian Mackervoy explains that the promised rest points

to a future of peace and blessing opened by the Messiah, fulfilling what the wilderness generation only

glimpsed.<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='#MackervoyHebrews' title='MackervoyHebrews'><sup class='textsuperscript'>21</sup></a></span><a id='x1-10001f21'></a> 

John Owen adds, “Christ’s priesthood and sacrifice grant access to

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Rest</strong> (<span class='ec-lmri-12'>katapausis </span>and <span class='ec-lmri-12'>sabbatismos</span>, Heb 4:9) symbolises salvation’s goal, entered

      through the Messiah’s supremacy, the new covenant, and priesthood, dependent on

      faith, exhibited in holiness, and jeopardised by unbelief, framed by Old Testament

      references (e.g., Ps 95).

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Covenant  fulfilment</strong>  highlights  the  Messiah’s  completion  of  Old  Testament

      promises, surpassing the old covenant through His supremacy, priesthood, and new

      covenant, requiring faith and inspiring holiness, with warnings against rejecting the

      fulfilled covenant (e.g., Jer 31).

      </li>

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Access to God’s presence</strong> emphasises salvation’s relational aspect, enabled by the

      Messiah’s mediation, secured through the new covenant and priesthood, accessed by

      faith, expressed in holiness, and lost through syncretism, rooted in Old Testament

      sanctuary imagery.

      <li class='itemize'><strong>Perfection</strong>  underscores   salvation’s   completion,   achieved   by   the   Messiah’s

      supremacy,  priesthood,  and  new  covenant,  received  through  faith,  reflected  in

      holiness,  and  forfeited  by  rejecting  His  atonement,  contrasting  with  the  Old

      Testament’s ineffective sacrifices.</li></ul>

<!-- l. 545 --><p class='noindent'>Rest is experiential, symbolising salvation’s goal; covenant fulfilment is theological, focusing on Old

Testament fulfilment; access to God’s presence is relational, emphasising intimacy; and

perfection is soteriological, highlighting completion. These motifs, grounded in the Old

Testament, create a cohesive narrative exalting the Messiah.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='conclusion'><span class='titlemark'>10   </span> <a id='x1-1100010'></a>Conclusion</h3>

<!-- l. 552 --><p class='noindent'>The Book of Hebrews weaves a rich theological tapestry grounded in Old Testament

imagery and fulfilled in the Messiah. Its core themes—the Messiah’s supremacy, the new

covenant, His eternal priesthood, faith and perseverance, the call to holiness and

worship, and the warning against rejecting His atonement—together present a sustained

argument for the sufficiency of the Messiah’s work and the necessity of enduring

faith. Interwoven throughout are the motifs of rest, covenant fulfilment, access to

God’s presence, and perfection, each deepening the epistle’s message and unifying its

structure.

</p><!-- l. 565 --><p class='indent'>   Crucially, Hebrews presents not merely a rejection of the old covenant but a transformative

fulfilment of it. While certain elements—such as the Levitical priesthood and repeated

sacrifices—are rendered obsolete in light of the Messiah’s once-for-all atonement (Heb 10:1–14),

the theological arc of Scripture is not broken but brought to maturity. The new covenant does

not abolish God’s former dealings but reveals their intended goal in the Messiah (Heb 8:6–13,

10:1). This dual movement—both discontinuity and continuity—invites readers to interpret

Scripture not as static law but as dynamic promise, fulfilled through the incarnate Son and now

mediated to believers through faith.

</p><!-- l. 577 --><p class='indent'>   Theologically, this calls readers to embrace the Messiah as the exclusive and sufficient means

of access to God, cautioning against any return to performance-based righteousness or religious

syncretism. Practically, Hebrews exhorts believers to perseverance in trials, confident access to

God’s presence (Heb 4:16), reverent holiness (Heb 12:14, 28), and deep trust in the promises yet

to be fully seen (Heb 11:1). The motifs function not only as literary devices but as discipleship

tools, guiding believers into experiential rest, covenantal identity, relational intimacy, and the

hope of perfected salvation.

</p><!-- l. 587 --><p class='indent'>   Ultimately, Hebrews compels a response: to trust fully in the sufficiency of the Messiah’s

finished work, to live in gratitude for God’s fulfilled promises, and to await, with patient

perseverance, the final consummation of the salvation already secured.

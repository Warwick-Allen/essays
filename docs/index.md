## About This Document

This theological profile presents a systematic overview of Warwick Allen's personal theological convictions, organised by major doctrinal categories. It is intended to provide clarity on theological positions for pastors, church leaders, fellow believers, and anyone interested in understanding his particular theological framework.

### Confidence and Importance Indicators

Throughout this document, certain beliefs are marked with **confidence levels** and **importance ratings**:

**Confidence Levels** (scale of 1-6):
- **6**: Maximum confidence - as certain as belief in the external world; unlikely to ever be dissuaded.
- **5**: Very strong confidence - would require overwhelmingly strong argument to be dissuaded.
- **4**: Strong confidence - could be dissuaded by very strong counter-argument.
- **3**: Moderate confidence - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.
- **2**: Held lightly - could easily be dissuaded given new information or argumentation.
- **1**: Undecided on this matter.

**Importance Ratings** (scale of 1-6):
- **6**: Fundamental doctrine of Christianity; denying this is heresy and might put one's salvation in jeopardy.
- **5**: Denying this is heterodox but not heresy; a serious error that will severely impact one's Christian walk.
- **4**: Important topic with room for disagreement within orthodox Christianity.
- **3**: Moderate importance; Christians within the same fellowship might disagree.
- **2**: Low importance; Christians should not spend much time debating this.
- **1**: Mere curiosity of negligible importance.

**Areas of Ongoing Study**: Where importance exceeds confidence by 2 or more points, the topic is subject to ongoing study and theological development.

## Executive Summary

This theological profile represents a thoughtful and internally coherent synthesis of beliefs drawn from multiple Christian traditions. The core commitments are:

1. **Molinist Arminian Soteriology** - emphasising libertarian free will, universal atonement, and prevenient grace.
2. **Baptist Ecclesiology and Sacramentology** - believers' baptism, regenerate church membership, but with unusually high sacramental theology.
3. **Charismatic Pneumatology** - normative continuationism with careful biblical testing.
4. **Progressive Sanctification** - rejecting entire sanctification as attainable in this life in favour of asymptotic growth towards holiness.
5. **Reformed Baptist Anthropology** - corrupted nature without inherited guilt before accountability.

This combination places the holder within the **Free Will Baptist** theological stream, with significant charismatic convictions and philosophical sophistication through Molinism.

## I. Theological Method and Authority

### Scripture and Authority
- **Primary Position**: Scripture is the supreme and sufficient authority for all matters of faith and practice
- **Core Doctrines**: For essential doctrines (salvation, Christ's person and work), Scripture alone suffices (closer to *sola scriptura*)
- **Secondary Matters**: Tradition (especially early Church Fathers), reason, and experience serve as valuable interpretive tools with genuine theological authority
- **Confidence Level**: High (5-6 on personal scale)

### Hermeneutics
- **Biblical Inspiration**: Plenary verbal inspiration - all parts of Scripture equally inspired by God
- **Infallibility**: Didactic infallibility - everything the Bible intends to teach is infallible and authoritative
- **Inerrancy Nuance**: The Bible may contain errors in incidental, non-didactic statements, but this doesn't deny divine superintendence
- **Perspicuity**: Core doctrines necessary for salvation are sufficiently clear for all people to understand
- **Canon**: The 66 books of the Protestant canon are the only authoritative books
- **Preservation**: Divine preservation ensures no errors in transmission impact core doctrines

### The Canon of Scripture

**Formation and Recognition**
- Divine Authority: A writing is canonical Scripture if, and only if, it was breathed out by God (2 Timothy 3:16).
- Church Recognition: The Church recognised books that already possessed divine authority; the Church did not confer authority upon them.
- Role of Councils: Church councils played a limited role in helping the Church recognise the canon, but did not establish it.
- Marks of Canonicity: Apostolic authorship or approval, the Holy Spirit's witness to the Church, and the internal qualities of the books themselves all served as clues helping the Church recognise which books were breathed out by God and divinely appointed to be recorded as Scripture.
- Confidence Level: High (5)

**Closure of the Canon**
- Closed Canon: The canon is closed; no new books can be added to Scripture.
- Confidence Level: Very strong (5) - would require overwhelmingly strong argument to be dissuaded.
- Importance Rating: High (5) - denying this is heterodox but not heresy; a serious error that will severely impact one's Christian walk.
- Distinction from Prophecy: Other prophecy (not recorded as Scripture) may also be breathed out by God, but the nature of these prophecies (e.g., limited scope) and the Spirit's guidance did not lead the Church to recognise them as Scripture.

**The Deuterocanonical Books**
- Status: The books included in the Catholic and Orthodox canons but not in the Protestant canon (Tobit, Judith, 1-2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, additions to Esther and Daniel) are useful for historical understanding but are not authoritative Scripture.
- Use in Teaching: May be read in church services and used for teaching, but only as aids to the exegesis of canonical Scripture.
- Caution Required: Care should be taken to prevent listeners from thinking of these books as Scripture.
- Bible Printing: Preference is that deuterocanonical books not be printed in Bibles to maintain clear distinction between canon and other writings, though this is not strongly held; if included, clear separation from canonical text is essential.
- Confidence Level: Low (2) - held lightly regarding their use in teaching.

### Relationship Between Old and New Testaments

**Four Relational Frameworks**
The Old and New Testaments relate to one another through multiple complementary frameworks, none of which needs to be ranked above the others:

1. **Promise and Fulfilment**: The Old Testament contains promises that find their fulfilment in the New Testament, supremely in Christ.

2. **Type and Antitype**: Old Testament persons, events, and institutions were real and served genuine purposes in their own contexts, whilst also foreshadowing greater realities fulfilled in Christ and the New Covenant. (Note: "Type and antitype" is preferred over "shadow and reality" because the types were absolutely real, even as they pointed forward.)

3. **Continuity with Discontinuity**: The testaments share fundamental continuity in God's character, purposes, and moral standards, whilst also exhibiting significant discontinuity in covenantal arrangements, ceremonial requirements, and the progressive unfolding of redemption.

4. **Progressive Revelation**: God progressively revealed His character, purposes, and redemptive plan throughout history, with fuller revelation coming in the New Testament and supremely in Christ, "the exact imprint of his nature" (Hebrews 1:3).

- Confidence Level: Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.
- Importance Rating: Moderate (3) - Christians within the same fellowship might disagree.

### The Mosaic Law and Christian Ethics

**Fulfilment in Christ**
- Vicarious Fulfilment: Christ fulfilled all the law; Christians vicariously fulfil the law by being united to Christ.
- Not Under the Mosaic Covenant: Christians are not under the Mosaic Covenant as a covenant system.

**Determining Binding Laws**
When discerning which Old Testament moral standards remain binding:
- **Covenant-People vs. All-People Laws**: Laws given outside the Mosaic Covenant or explicitly applied to Gentile nations are typically binding for all people across all time.
- **Gentile Judgements**: Attention should be paid to the reasons for judgements wrought against Gentile nations in the Old Testament, as these reveal universal moral standards.
- **New Testament Reaffirmation**: When New Testament epistles restate an Old Testament law, this generally indicates the law has been carried over into the Church era and remains binding upon Christians.
- **Caution with Gospel Accounts**: Care must be taken when interpreting Jesus' words in the Gospels, as He was primarily speaking to people still living under the Old Covenant; careful examination of context is required.
- **Grey Areas**: Careful Bible study will clarify which laws were for Israel only and which were for all people.

**Examples and Applications**
- Ceremonial and Civil Laws: Laws unique to Israel's covenant status (such as circumcision post-Christ, dietary restrictions, festivals, temple rituals) are not binding on Christians.
- Universal Moral Laws: Laws reflecting God's unchanging character and applied beyond Israel (such as prohibitions on murder, adultery, theft, idolatry, sexual immorality) remain binding.
- Jerusalem Council: The advice to avoid blood and strangled animals (Acts 15) represents a grey area requiring careful consideration.

- Confidence Level: Moderate (3) - the framework needs refinement for edge cases, though strong confidence exists that Christians are not required to keep Mosaic laws never applied to Gentiles.

### Theological Framework
- **Molinism (Middle Knowledge)**: God knows what free-will choice any creature will make in any circumstance, including all counterfactual truths
- **Purpose**: This framework reconciles divine sovereignty with libertarian human freedom
- **Confidence**: High (5 on personal scale)

---

## II. Theology Proper (Doctrine of God)

### Essential Attributes
All held with highest confidence (5-6):
- **Trinity**: One being in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
- **Aseity**: Self-existing, necessary, non-contingent being
- **Eternality**: No beginning or end; exists outside created time but entered time at creation
- **Omnipresence**: Present throughout all creation while remaining distinct from it
- **Omniscience**: Knows all truth, including future events and counterfactuals (via middle knowledge)
- **Transcendence and Immanence**: Both beyond creation and actively present within it
- **Greatest Being**: That of which nothing greater can be conceived

### Divine Sovereignty
- **Sovereignty and Freedom**: God knowingly allows every event that occurs
- **Molinist Framework**: God exercises meticulous providence through middle knowledge while respecting libertarian free will
- **Time and God**: God entered into time when He created it (presentist view)

---

## III. Christology

All Christological affirmations held with the highest confidence (5-6):

### Person of Christ
- **Deity**: Jesus is the Son of God, consubstantial with the Father
- **Incarnation**: Added human nature to divine nature; fully God and fully human
- **Virgin Birth**: Mary was virgin until after Jesus' birth
- **Creator**: All things made through Christ
- **Messiah**: Fulfilment of Hebrew Scriptures' prophecies

### Work of Christ
- **Crucifixion**: Died under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried
- **Resurrection**: Rose bodily on the third day
- **Ascension**: Ascended to heaven, seated at the Father's right hand
- **Second Coming**: Will return to judge living and dead
- **Revelation**: Jesus is the full revelation of God's nature and character

---

## IV. Anthropology and Hamartiology

### Nature of Humanity
- **Image of God**: Humans created male and female in God's image, sharing attributes to finite extent
- **Two Genders**: Only male and female, corresponding to biological sex
- **Purpose**: Created as recipients of God's love; chief end is to glorify and enjoy God forever
- **Libertarian Free Will**: Humans possess genuine libertarian freedom
- **Historicity**: Adam and Eve were actual historical people (lived 6,000 to 1,000,000 years ago)

### Original Sin and the Fall
**Key Distinctive**: Corruption without inherited guilt

- **Corrupted Nature**: All humans inherit Adam's corrupted nature (tendency toward sin, spiritual brokenness)
- **No Inherited Guilt**: Adam's descendants are NOT guilty of his sin at birth; guilt requires personal moral agency
- **Total Depravity**: All aspects of human nature affected by the Fall
- **Physical Death**: Universal consequence of Adam's sin (corporate/biological), but not personal punishment for those without guilt
- **Enmity with God**: Unregenerate persons are enemies of God due to personal sin once accountable

### Sin
- **Definition**: Failure to follow God's commands; offence against God
- **Moral Agency Requirement**: Sin only incurs guilt when committed with moral agency (ability to choose otherwise)
- **Infants and Sin**: Infants manifest sinful actions (as "sinners" = "people who sin") but without moral culpability
- **Age of Accountability**: Varies by individual based on cognitive/moral development; exact timing known only to God
- **Cognitively Disabled**: Those who never develop moral agency remain in innocent state throughout life

### Infant and Child Soteriology
**Distinctive Position**: Innocence until accountability

- **Before Accountability**: Children are legally innocent, having corrupted nature but no personal guilt
- **Need for Atonement**: Christ's work addresses corrupted nature, enabling children to remain in relationship with God
- **Status (1 Cor 7:14)**: Children of believers are "holy" - set apart in covenant community
- **Salvation of Infants**: Those who die before accountability are saved (no guilt to condemn them)
- **Parental Responsibility**: Parents should disciple children toward faith as understanding develops
- **Young Conversion**: Children can exercise saving faith as young as 4 years old with basic understanding ("I need Jesus")

---

## V. Soteriology (Doctrine of Salvation)

### Arminian Framework
Strongly held positions (confidence 3-5):

**The Five Articles of Remonstrance (Arminian Distinctive):**

1. **Conditional Election**: God elected a people (Israel, then the Church by adoption); individuals become elect when they trust in Christ
2. **Universal Atonement**: Christ's atoning work was on behalf of and sufficient for all people
3. **Total Depravity with Prevenient Grace**: No one can come to God unless God first calls and enables them; all receive prevenient grace
4. **Resistible Grace**: God grants people ability to reject His call to salvation
5. **Perseverance**: *Uncertain* - leans toward belief that regenerate believers may fall away, but holds with very low confidence (ongoing study)

### Prevenient Grace
- **Nature**: Supernatural grace given to all people, enabling free acceptance or rejection of God's call
- **Function**: Restores capacity for moral response lost in the Fall
- **Application**: May work gradually or immediately; all God's preparatory work precedes faith
- **Infants**: Exact mechanics unclear; ensures all have genuine opportunity to respond

### Atonement Theories
Multiple aspects affirmed:
- **Penal Substitutionary**: Christ bore punishment for our sins
- **Ransom**: Christ paid ransom to deliver from bondage to sin
- **Propitiation**: Christ's death satisfied God's wrath against sin
- **Effectual Application**: Becomes effective when person repents and trusts Christ

### Justification and Sanctification
- **Justification**: Instantaneous, forensic declaration of righteousness by faith alone
- **Initial Sanctification**: Begins simultaneously with justification at regeneration
- **Progressive Sanctification**: Holy Spirit begins process of growth in holiness at new birth
- **Relationship**: Cannot have justification without sanctification beginning
- **Complete Freedom from Sin**: Only achieved at glorification, not in this life
- **Asymptotic Progress**: Believers grow progressively toward holiness but never achieve sinless perfection in this life

**Major Difference from Wesleyanism**: Rejects entire sanctification/Christian perfection as attainable in this life

### Faith and Works
- **Justification**: By faith alone; works have no merit in justification
- **Necessity of Works**: Saving faith necessarily produces good works as evidence
- **Relationship**: Faith is the root, works are the fruit

### Assurance
- **Direct Witness**: Comes through Holy Spirit's witness to believer's spirit
- **Indirect Witness**: Confirmed by fruit of sanctification over time
- **False Assurance**: Purported Spirit witness without evidence of sanctification is likely illusory
- **Confidence**: High (5)

---

## VI. Ecclesiology and Church Practice

### Nature of the Church
- **Universal Church**: The invisible body of all true believers where salvation occurs
- **Local Church**: Membership essential for normal Christian life, though not strictly necessary for salvation itself
- **Social Holiness**: Christianity must be lived in community; believers need fellowship and accountability
- **Church Authority**: Any person or organisation attempting to issue binding decrees on all believers' consciences is antichrist

### Church Offices
- **Biblical Offices Only**: Elder (pastor, overseer, bishop) and deacon
- **Eldership**: Only men may serve as elders; must be "one-woman men" (faithful if married, chaste if single); divorced men may serve in some circumstances
- **Deacons**: Both men and women may serve
- **Titles**: Elders should not use titles like "pastor" or "father" (held lightly, confidence 2)
- **Authority Structure**: Prophets and apostles (missionaries) subject to elder authority

### Church Mission
- **Evangelism**: Primary mission, addressing eternal salvation
- **Social Action**: Mandatory but secondary; flows from genuine faith
- **Balance**: Both are essential expressions of the gospel
- **Not Dominionist**: Church not expected to control secular world until Christ returns

---

## VII. Sacraments and Ordinances

### Baptism
**Distinctive**: Believers' baptism with high sacramental theology

**Nature and Meaning:**
- **Ordained by Christ**: A ritual commanded by Christ
- **Believers Only**: Should only be undertaken by professing believers
- **Not Necessary for Salvation**: But necessary for obedience to Christ
- **Profession of Faith**: Involves profession of faith and repentance from sin
- **Multiple Symbolism**: 
  - Death of old nature and creation of new nature
  - Identification with Christ
  - Induction into Church membership
- **Sign and Sacrament**: Both symbol and means of grace
- **Supernatural Work**: God does supernatural work at baptism in addition to regeneration at first belief
- **Duty and Privilege**: Believer's duty and pleasure to seek baptism

**Mode:**
- **Proper Form**: Full immersion (confidence 3)
- **Other Modes Valid**: Those baptised by other modes need not be re-baptised (confidence 2, subject to study)

**Theological Rationale for Believers' Baptism:**
- Infants have no inherited guilt requiring cleansing
- Baptism signifies personal faith and identification with Christ's death/resurrection
- Requires moral agency that infants lack
- Children already "holy" (1 Cor 7:14) in covenant community without baptism

### The Lord's Supper (Eucharist)
**Distinctive**: High sacramental view unusual in Baptist circles

**Nature:**
- **Ordained by Christ**: A ritual commanded by Christ
- **Means of Grace**: Genuine channel through which God conveys grace (confidence 2, subject to study)
- **Real Spiritual Presence**: Christ is spiritually present; communicates grace to worthy receivers
- **Not Merely Memorial**: Rejects Zwinglian memorialism
- **Not Transubstantiation**: Rejects Roman Catholic doctrine

**Practice:**
- **Frequency**: Should partake frequently (as often as possible)
- **Open to Believers**: All true believers may partake, even if not yet baptised
- **Closed to Non-Believers**: Non-believers may not partake

---

## VIII. Pneumatology (Doctrine of the Holy Spirit)

### Person of the Spirit
- **Deity**: Consubstantial with Father and Son.
- **Work in Salvation**: Regenerates, begins sanctification at conversion, continues sanctifying work throughout believer's earthly life, and provides assurance.

### Spiritual Gifts
**Distinctive**: Normative continuationism with careful biblical boundaries

**Position on Gifts:**
- **Continuationism**: All gifts continue throughout the Church age (Pentecost to Second Coming)
- **Active Today**: Prophecy, tongues, healing, and all gifts should be normative in the church
- **Biblical Guidelines**: When practiced, must accord with biblical instructions
- **Testing Required**: All prophecy must be tested against Scripture

**Contemporary Prophecy:**
- **Divine Source**: God gives prophetic words for guidance, encouragement, and direction
- **Fallible Reception**: God's words are infallible, but prophet's reception/interpretation is fallible
- **Scripture Supreme**: All prophecy must be tested against Scripture
- **No Contradiction**: No true prophecy will contradict biblical teaching
- **Not Scripture-Level Authority**: Does not equal biblical authority

**Deliverance Ministry:**
- **Demonisation Possible**: Demons can seriously affect believers' lives (confidence 2)
- **Demonic Control**: Demons can control non-believers' bodies
- **Deliverance Available**: Demonised persons can be set free through prayer

**Balance:**
- **Experience Governed by Scripture**: Religious experience is real and important but must be subordinate to rational understanding of Scripture
- **Guarding Against Error**: Subjective feelings untethered from biblical truth lead to heresy (e.g., Mormon "burning in the bosom")

---

## IX. Means of Grace

### General Principle
- **Essential Channels**: Means of grace are ordinary channels through which God conveys grace
- **Not Merely Helpful**: Essential for spiritual growth, not optional
- **God's Ordinary Method**: Grace ordinarily flows through these means, though God is not bound by them

### Instituted Means
Ordained by Christ:
- Prayer.
- Searching the Scriptures.
- The Lord's Supper.
- Baptism.
- Fasting.
- Christian fellowship (conference).
- Service to the saints (exemplified by foot-washing).

### Prudential Means
- Public worship attendance.
- Good works.
- Self-denial.
- Taking up one's cross.
- Vigilance (watching) - spiritual alertness and awareness, being watchful against sin and temptation, maintaining readiness for Christ's return.

### Prayer
- **Healing**: God heals in response to prayer, both miraculously and by natural means
- **Delayed Healing**: Sometimes God delays healing; sometimes until resurrection
- **Declarative Prayer**: Christians should not declare something in prayer unless first revealed by God

---

## X. Christian Life and Ethics

### Sanctification and Holiness
- **Progressive Growth**: Believers grow in holiness throughout life
- **Not Perfectionist**: Complete freedom from sin only at glorification
- **Expectation**: Believers expected to live godly lives and show fruit of Spirit
- **Suffering**: Christians should expect to suffer for following Christ

### Stewardship and Wealth
- **Three Principles**: Earn all you can, save all you can, give all you can
- **Generous Giving**: Christians should give generously to local church and those in need
- **Not Legalistic Tithing**: Giving should be determined by Spirit's leading and conscience, not necessarily 10%
- **Subject to Calling**: Economic principles subject to specific divine calling (e.g., full-time ministry may require different approach)
- **Wealth Not Prosperity Gospel**: Rejects notion that prosperity is sign of God's blessing

### Marriage and Family
- **Definition**: Only between one man and one woman
- **Typology**: Represents Christ's relationship with His Church
- **Authority Structure**: Husband is spiritual head, lovingly serving wife; wife submits to his authority (complementarian)
- **Divorce**: Prohibited except in specific biblical circumstances
- **Sexual Ethics**: 
  - Sexual intercourse outside marriage is sinful
  - Homosexual acts are sinful

### Gender Roles
- **In Marriage**: Complementarian - different roles with husband as head
- **In Church**: 
  - Only men may be elders
  - Both men and women may be deacons
  - Both men and women may function as prophets as Spirit enables
  - Both may serve as apostles (missionaries)

---

## XI. Eschatology (Last Things)

### General Framework
**Premillennialism** (held with humility and low confidence)

### Order of Events
- **Pre-Tribulation Rapture**: Believers taken from earth at start of tribulation (confidence 2)
- **Seven-Year Tribulation**: God will afflict earth's inhabitants
- **Christ's Return**: Jesus will return to judge living and dead
- **Millennial Reign**: Christ will reign on earth for 1,000 years
- **Coexistence**: People with resurrection bodies will coexist with those with natural bodies
- **Final Rebellion**: Satan will incite rebellion at end of millennium
- **Final Battle**: Christ will destroy all who participate
- **Final Resurrection**: Everyone who has died will be resurrected to face judgement
- **Final Judgement**: Christ will judge everyone for their deeds
- **New Creation**: God will destroy and recreate heavens and earth

### Intermediate State
- **Immediate Consciousness**: Upon death, believers' spirits immediately enter God's presence while awaiting bodily resurrection
- **Awaiting Resurrection**: Not soul sleep; conscious existence in intermediate state

### Final States
- **Hell (Lake of Fire)**: 
  - Those whose names not in Book of Life will be cast into lake of fire
  - Conscious, never-ending torment (not annihilationism)
  - Confidence level: 3 (moderate)
- **New Heavens and Earth**: Believers resurrected into glorious, supernatural bodies
- **No Purgatory**: Rejects Roman Catholic doctrine
- **No Universalism**: Not all will be saved

---

## XII. Creation and Science

### Age and Process
**Old Earth Creationism with Theistic Evolution**

- **Universe Age**: Several billion years old (confidence 2)
- **Adam's Timing**: Lived 6,000 to 1,000,000 years ago (confidence 1 - very uncertain)
- **Genealogical Gaps**: Adam's genealogy likely contains omissions
- **Evolution**: God used evolution as one element of His creative work (confidence 2)
- **Progressive Creationism**: God supernaturally intervened at points to produce speciation (confidence 1)
- **Neo-Darwinism**: Neo-Darwinian macroevolution is not scientifically plausible (confidence 3)

### Hermeneutics of Genesis
- **Hermeneutical Freedom**: Various approaches to Genesis 1-6 can be considered orthodox
- **Days of Creation**: Six days should not be interpreted as literal 24-hour periods (confidence 3)
- **Genesis 6 Flood**: Regional event, not global (confidence 2)
- **Sons of God**: Fallen spiritual beings (confidence 2)

### Theology of Creation
- **Creator**: Father Almighty is maker of all things visible and invisible
- **Through Christ**: All things made through Christ
- **Time**: God created time and entered into it
- **Sustenance**: God actively sustains all creation, including Satan and demons
- **Angels and Demons**: Demons are created spiritual beings that are evil

### Philosophy
- **Anti-Platonism**: Abstract objects do not exist; if they do, they're contingent on God (confidence 3)
- **Presentism**: Only present time exists; past has ceased, future hasn't yet come (confidence 3)

---

## XIII. Other Doctrines

### Mariology
- **Virgin Birth**: Mary was virgin until after Jesus' birth
- **Other Children**: Mary did not remain perpetually virgin; bore other children
- **Prayer to Mary**: Attempting to pray to Mary or other departed saints is prohibited
- **No Special Status**: Rejects Catholic Marian dogmas

### Biblical Translations
- **Multiple Good Translations**: Many very good English translations exist
- **Modern Advantages**: Modern translations have advantages due to Dead Sea Scrolls
- **Warning**: "The Passion Translation" is dangerous and should be avoided

---

## XIV. Areas of Ongoing Study

The following areas are marked for ongoing study (where confidence is 2+ points below importance):

1. **Perseverance of the Saints** (∆=2): Whether regenerate believers can fall away
2. **Demonisation of Believers** (∆=2): Extent to which demons can affect Christians
3. **Modes of Baptism** (∆=2): Whether non-immersion baptisms are valid
4. **Timing of Adam** (∆=2): When Adam lived
5. **Baptism as Sacrament** (∆=2): Exact nature of supernatural work at baptism
6. **Various Creation Topics** (∆=1-2): Details of evolutionary process, flood extent, etc.

---

## XV. Alignment with Historic Creeds

This section examines alignment with the most significant ecumenical creeds of historic Christianity. These creeds represent the theological consensus of the early Church and continue to serve as standards of orthodoxy across the Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions.

### The Apostles' Creed

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, with full agreement.

The Apostles' Creed represents the most basic and ancient summary of Christian faith. Full affirmation of all articles:

- Belief in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.
- Belief in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.
- Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary.
- Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
- **Descended into hell/to the dead**: Affirmed - Christ's spirit went to Hades/Sheol to proclaim victory between His death and resurrection.
- Rose again from the dead on the third day.
- Ascended into heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father.
- Will come again to judge the living and the dead.
- Belief in the Holy Spirit.
- **The holy catholic Church**: Affirmed - "catholic" meaning the one, universal Church of all true believers.
- The communion of saints.
- The forgiveness of sins.
- The resurrection of the body.
- The life everlasting.

**Significance**: The Apostles' Creed represents the core of Christian orthodoxy and is affirmed without reservation.

### The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (Nicene Creed)

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, with full agreement.

This creed, formulated at the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), provides the definitive statement on Trinitarian and Christological orthodoxy. Full affirmation of all articles:

**On the Father:**
- One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

**On the Son:**
- One Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God.
- Begotten of the Father before all worlds.
- God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God.
- Begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.
- By whom all things were made.
- Who for us and for our salvation came down from heaven.
- Was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.
- Was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried.
- Rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures.
- Ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father.
- Shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead.
- Whose kingdom shall have no end.

**On the Holy Spirit:**
- The Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life.
- Who proceeds from the Father (note: see discussion of *filioque* below).
- Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified.
- Who spoke by the prophets.

**On the Church and Sacraments:**
- **One holy catholic and apostolic Church**: Affirmed - "catholic" meaning universal; the Church is one, holy, universal, and built on apostolic foundation.
- **One baptism for the forgiveness of sins**: Affirmed with nuance - "one baptism" meaning baptism into Christ is the only valid baptism regardless of particular mode; "for the forgiveness of sins" is affirmed in that baptism should quickly follow faith, and Scripture often treats regeneration and baptism as a single event, though if baptism is delayed, forgiveness is still applied through faith in anticipation of baptism.
- The resurrection of the dead.
- The life of the world to come.

**The *Filioque* Question:**
The original creed states the Spirit "proceeds from the Father." The Western Church later added "*and the Son*" (*filioque*). The position held here is that the Spirit "proceeds from the Father, through the Son" - closer to the Eastern Orthodox formulation. However, this does not constitute rejection of the Western addition; rather, agnosticism regarding the precise mechanism of procession is maintained. The Spirit's procession is somehow related to the Son, whether "from" or "through" the Son, but strict insistence on one formulation over the other is avoided.

**Significance**: The Nicene Creed represents the definitive statement of Trinitarian orthodoxy and is affirmed in its fullness.

### The Chalcedonian Definition (451)

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, complete agreement.

The Definition of Chalcedon provides the orthodox formulation of Christ's two natures. Full affirmation:

- Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man.
- Of a reasonable soul and body.
- Consubstantial with the Father according to His Godhead.
- Consubstantial with us according to His manhood.
- Like us in all things, sin only excepted.
- **One and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures:**
  - **Without confusion** (the natures are not mixed).
  - **Without change** (the natures are not altered).
  - **Without division** (the natures are not separated into two persons).
  - **Without separation** (the natures remain united in one person).
- The distinction of natures is in no way abolished by their union.
- Rather, the property of each nature is preserved.
- Both natures concur in one person and one subsistence.
- Not parted or divided into two persons.
- But one and the same Son, Only-begotten, God the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ.

**Significance**: The Chalcedonian Definition is the gold standard for Christological orthodoxy, guarding against all major heresies (Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Apollinarianism, Arianism). It is affirmed completely and without qualification.

### The Athanasian Creed

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, with one significant qualification.

The Athanasian Creed (likely 5th-6th century) provides the most detailed exposition of Trinitarian theology among the ecumenical creeds. It is affirmed in its theological content with one important pastoral qualification.

**Trinitarian Theology** - Fully Affirmed:
- The catholic (universal) faith is to worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity.
- Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.
- The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God.
- Yet there are not three Gods, but one God.
- The three persons are co-eternal and co-equal.
- Each is uncreated, incomprehensible, eternal, almighty, Lord, and God.
- Yet not three uncreated, incomprehensible, eternal, almighty, or Gods, but one.

**Christology** - Fully Affirmed:
- Perfect God and perfect man.
- Of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.
- Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead.
- Inferior to the Father as touching His manhood.
- One Christ, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God.
- One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.

**Procession of the Spirit** - Affirmed with Nuance:
The creed states: "The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son: not made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding."

This represents the Western (*filioque*) position. As noted above, the position held here is that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, closer to the Eastern formulation. However, the Western formulation is not rejected; rather, agnosticism is maintained about the precise mechanism. The creed's affirmation that the Spirit's procession is somehow related to the Son is affirmed, whether expressed as "from" or "through."

**Damnatory Clauses** - Qualified:
The creed contains strong language: "Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly."

**Qualification**: Whilst Trinitarian orthodoxy is essential to Christianity and represents fundamental truth, this strong formulation is qualified pastorally. Trinitarian orthodoxy is necessary for the mature believers who have had opportunity to understand it, but salvation is not denied to the new or simple believers who have genuine faith in Christ but have not yet grasped the full Trinitarian theology. The thief on the cross, for instance, was saved through simple faith in Christ without articulating the Nicene theology.

This qualification does not represent the rejection of Trinitarian orthodoxy's importance, but rather the pastoral sensitivity to believers at different stages of theological understanding.

**Significance**: The Athanasian Creed represents the most thorough articulation of Trinitarian theology in creedal form. Its theological content is affirmed, with the pastoral qualification on its damnatory clauses.

### Summary of Creedal Alignment

**Full Affirmation:**
- Apostles' Creed (100%)
- Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (100%, with acknowledged nuance on *filioque*)
- Chalcedonian Definition (100%)

**Qualified Affirmation:**
- Athanasian Creed (theological content 100%; pastoral qualification on damnatory clauses)

This creedal alignment places this theological position firmly within **the historic Christian orthodoxy** as recognised by the Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions. The nuances on the *filioque* and the pastoral qualification on the Athanasian Creed's damnatory clauses represent careful theological distinctions rather than the departure from orthodoxy.

The affirmation of these creeds demonstrates the commitment to:
- The Nicene Trinitarianism.
- The Chalcedonian Christology.
- The unity and catholicity of the Church.
- The historic Christian orthodoxy across traditions.
- The ecumenical consensus of the early Church.

## XVI. Theological Identity and Tradition

### Primary Identity
**Molinist Arminian Baptist Charismatic** with high sacramental convictions

### Closest Denominational Fit
1. **Free Will Baptist** (primary fit)
2. Charismatic Baptist churches with Arminian theology
3. Churches of Christ (charismatic-leaning)
4. Independent charismatic evangelical churches
5. Some Vineyard churches

### Alignment with Historic Wesleyanism
**55-60% Strong Alignment**

**Areas of Agreement:**
- Arminian soteriology (prevenient grace, universal atonement, conditional election)
- High view of means of grace

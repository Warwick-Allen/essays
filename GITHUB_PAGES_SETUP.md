# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

This repository is configured to publish Warwick Allen's Theological Profile as a public-facing website using GitHub Pages.

## üìã What Was Set Up

### 1. **docs Directory** (`/docs`)
   - Contains all files served by GitHub Pages
   - `index.md` - Copy of the theological profile (auto-synced)
   - `_config.yml` - Jekyll configuration
   - `assets/css/style.scss` - Custom styling for better presentation

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/update-github-pages.yml`)
   - Automatically copies changes from `Theological Profile/warwick_allen_theological_profile.md` to `docs/index.md`
   - Triggers on any commit to the main branch that affects the source file
   - Ensures the published version stays in sync with the source

### 3. **Jekyll Configuration** (`docs/_config.yml`)
   - Uses the Cayman theme for a clean, professional appearance
   - Configured with proper metadata and SEO settings
   - Enables automatic table of contents and other helpful features

### 4. **Custom Styling** (`docs/assets/css/style.scss`)
   - Enhanced typography and readability
   - Improved heading hierarchy
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Print-friendly styling

## üöÄ Enabling GitHub Pages

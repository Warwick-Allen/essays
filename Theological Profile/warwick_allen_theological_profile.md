## About This Document

This theological profile presents a systematic overview of Warwick Allen's
personal theological convictions, organised by major doctrinal categories. It is
intended to provide clarity on theological positions for pastors, church
leaders, fellow believers, and anyone interested in understanding his particular
theological framework.

### Confidence and Importance Indicators

Throughout this document, certain beliefs are marked with **confidence levels**
and **importance ratings**:

#### Confidence Levels

The confidence levels use a scale of 1–6:

- **6**: Maximum confidence - as certain as belief in the external world;
  unlikely to ever be dissuaded.
- **5**: Very strong confidence - would require overwhelmingly strong argument
  to be dissuaded.
- **4**: Strong confidence - could be dissuaded by very strong counter-argument.
- **3**: Moderate confidence - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.
- **2**: Held lightly - could easily be dissuaded given new information or
  argumentation.
- **1**: Undecided on this matter.

#### Importance Ratings

The importance ratings use a scale of 1–6:

- **6**: Fundamental doctrine of Christianity; denying this is heresy and might
  put one's salvation in jeopardy.
- **5**: Denying this is heterodox but not heresy; a serious error that will
  severely impact one's Christian walk.
- **4**: Important topic with room for disagreement within orthodox
  Christianity.
- **3**: Moderate importance; Christians within the same fellowship might
  disagree.
- **2**: Low importance; Christians should not spend much time debating this.
- **1**: Mere curiosity of negligible importance.

#### Areas of Ongoing Study

Where importance exceeds confidence by 2 or more points, the topic is subject to
ongoing study and theological development.

## Executive Summary

This theological profile represents a thoughtful and internally coherent
synthesis of beliefs drawn from multiple Christian traditions. The core
commitments are:

1. #### Molinist Arminian Soteriology

   Emphasising libertarian free will, universal atonement, and prevenient grace.

2. #### Baptist Ecclesiology and Sacramentology

   Believers' baptism, regenerate church membership, but with unusually high
   sacramental theology.

3. #### Charismatic Pneumatology

   Normative continuationism with careful biblical testing.

4. #### Progressive Sanctification

   Rejecting entire sanctification as attainable in this life in favour of
asymptotic growth towards holiness.

5. #### Reformed Baptist Anthropology

   Corrupted nature without inherited guilt before accountability.

This combination places the holder within the **Free Will Baptist** theological
stream, with significant charismatic convictions and philosophical
sophistication through Molinism.

# I. Theological Method and Authority

## Scripture and Authority

- #### Primary Position

  Scripture is the supreme and sufficient authority for all
  matters of faith and practice.

- #### Core Doctrines

  For essential doctrines (salvation, Christ's person and work),
  Scripture alone suffices (closer to sola scriptura).

- #### Secondary Matters

  Tradition (especially early Church Fathers), reason, and
  experience serve as valuable interpretive tools with genuine theological
  authority.

- #### Confidence Level

  High (5-6 on personal scale).

- #### No Contradiction

  The New Testament never overturns or contradicts the Old
  Testament.

- #### Law's Fulfilment

- Because Christ has fulfilled the Law, many aspects are not
  directly applicable to Christians, though the entire Law retains indirect
  applicability.

- #### Israel and Church

  Promises and commands given to Israel are not automatically
  transferred to the Church.

- #### Scriptural Justification Required

  To believe a promise or command given to
  Israel carries over to the Church requires scriptural justification beyond
  mere assumption of inheritance.

- #### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

### Typology

#### Nature of Types

- ##### Christological Focus

  All Scripture points to Christ in some way; if proposed
  typology does not point to Christ, scepticism is warranted.

- ##### Spirit-Led Discovery

  Individuals might find types through the Spirit's
  illumination.

- ##### NT-Grounded Patterns

  Typology should be grounded in patterns the New
  Testament itself establishes.

- ##### Consistency with NT Types

  Valid types should be the same kind of thing as
  explicitly-identified NT types (bronze serpent, rock Moses struck, Adam,
  various prophets).

- ##### Wide Range

  The New Testament identifies a wide range of types of Christ.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

### Progressive Revelation

#### Nature of Progressive Revelation

- ##### Earlier Incompleteness

  Earlier revelation can be incomplete or less clear
  without being erroneous.
- Later Revelation's Role: Later revelation adds details or layers of meaning
  but doesn't undermine correct understanding of earlier texts.

- ##### Correcting Misunderstanding

  Later revelation may correct erroneous
  interpretations of earlier revelation (e.g., Messiah's two comings rather than
  one).

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

### The Role of the Holy Spirit in Interpretation

#### Necessity of Illumination

- ##### Not Strictly Necessary

  Illumination by the Spirit is not necessary for
  correct interpretation of Scripture.

- ##### Unbelievers Can Interpret

  An unbeliever with proper tools may interpret
  Scripture accurately.

- ##### Helps Prevent Misinterpretation

  Without the Spirit's help, people are more
  likely to misinterpret Scripture through both (a) working on the interpreter's
  heart/humility, and (b) more directly guiding to correct understanding. It is
  unclear which is more common or fundamental in Scripture interpretation.

- ##### Personal Transformation

  The Spirit's help is required to translate
  intellectual understanding into personal transformation toward Christlikeness.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Low (2) - held lightly, could easily be dissuaded.

#### Insights Beyond Exegesis

- ##### No New Insights

  The Holy Spirit will not give believers insights into
  Scripture that go beyond what complete grammatical-historical exegesis would
  yield.

- ##### May Reveal Information

  The Spirit might reveal grammatical or historical
  information to aid otherwise incomplete exegesis.

- ##### Not for Doctrine

  Such specially-revealed information should not establish
  doctrine unless clearly verified using conventional methods, due to human
  fallibility in discerning the Spirit's voice.

- ##### Hypothetical

  This is discussed hypothetically; no bona fide instances of such
  revelation are known.

- ##### Verification Required

  Spirit's illumination should be subject to verification
  using objective interpretive methods due to human fallibility.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Low (2) - held lightly.

#### Spirit's Role in Belief

- ##### Necessary for Saving Faith

  The Spirit plays a necessary role in someone
  arriving at saving faith (John 6:44a; 2 Corinthians 3:14-16).

- ##### Confidence Level

  Very strong (5) on necessity for saving faith.

- ##### Details Uncertain

  Confidence in how this operates (e.g., whether someone can
  achieve thorough intellectual understanding apart from the Spirit) is much
  lower.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Low (2) on operational details - held lightly.

### Principles for Application

#### Foundational Approach

- ##### Stable Original Meaning

  Scripture has stable original meaning that must be
  discerned before application.

- ##### Christological Witness

  All Scripture ultimately bears witness to Christ (John
  5:39).

- ##### Textual Priority

  Internal textual evidence prioritised over external sources.

- ##### Grammatical-Historical Analysis

  Employed within canonical-covenantal
  framework considering redemptive history and covenant relationships.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Strong (4) - could be dissuaded by very strong
  counter-argument.

#### Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Texts

- ##### Narrative Purpose

  Narrative passages primarily reveal something about Christ
  or God's redemptive plan.

- ##### Secondary Behavioural Principles

  Only secondarily (if at all) provide
  behavioural principles, and only when supported by didactic texts or clear
  textual indicators of divine approval or disapproval.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Strong (4) on this principle.

#### Old Testament Narratives

- ##### Primarily Descriptive

  Record what happened as part of God's unfolding
  redemptive plan, not primarily prescriptive.

- ##### Primary Hermeneutical Move

  From "this happened" to "this tells us about
  Christ or God's redemptive plan" (consistent with John 5:39).

- ##### Behavioural Implications

  Only after identifying redemptive-historical
  significance should behavioural implications be considered, and then
  cautiously.

- ##### No Direct Moral Imperatives

  Cannot derive moral imperatives from narrative
  description alone without clear textual indicators (explicit divine
  approval/disapproval, didactic commentary, contextual clues establishing
  actions as moral examples).

- ##### Prefer Didactic Foundation

  Prefer to establish behavioural principles from
  didactic/prescriptive texts first, then use narratives as illustrations.

- ##### Pedagogical Not Authoritative Use

  When used illustratively, narratives
  function pedagogically rather than authoritatively in that specific
  application - the text remains authoritative Scripture in its primary purpose
  (historical record, revealing God's nature, redemptive plan), but is used
  non-authoritatively when illustrating secondary principles.

- ##### Some Narratives Lack Direct Application

  Some narratives are included because
  they advance the redemptive story and reveal God's character, not to model
  behaviour for emulation.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) on overall approach.

#### Meaning vs. Application

- ##### Objective Meaning

  The meaning of a text is objective.

- ##### Subjective Application

  Personal application should only be particular
  subjective application of universal objective meaning, not distinct meaning.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

#### Multiple Applications

- One Interpretation, Multiple Applications: A passage may have multiple valid
  applications while having only one correct interpretation.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Low (2) - held lightly, could easily be dissuaded.

#### Testing Against Community

- ##### Historical and Contemporary

  Interpretations tested against community of
  believers through consultation with commentaries, church leadership, and
  consensus of Church tradition.

- ##### Scripture as Ultimate Authority

  Scripture is ultimate authority, but the more
  an interpretation diverges from historical Christian consensus, the stronger
  the biblical evidence must be.

- ##### Strong Evidence Required

  Strong biblical evidence to depart from consensus must include:

  1.  a clear grammatical-historical analysis showing plain meaning in context;

  2.  explicit theological reasoning within the text, grounding the
  command in transcultural realities;

  3.  repetition across multiple biblical books/authors;

  4.  coherence with broader canonical narrative and central doctrines;

  5.  support preferably from didactic rather than merely narrative passages;

  6.  an accounting for all relevant texts, not just a selective use;

  7.  identification of why ithe historical consensus may have been influenced
  by extra-biblical factors;

  8.  a demonstration from Scripture why the traditional interpretation appears
  to be a misreading;

  9.  evidence substantial enough that other qualified interpreters could see
  the textual case, even if disagreeing;

  10. a case compelling enough to teach with intellectual integrity whilst
  fairly acknowledging the traditional view, and evidence so compelling that
  one cannot in good conscience hold the consensus view.

- ##### High Threshold in Practice

  In practice, no interpretations are held that lack
  at least strong minority support within historic Christianity, suggesting
  threshold for departing from consensus is quite high.

- ##### Scepticism of Personal Revelation

  Remain sceptical of personal "revelations"
  that conflict with established interpretation, recognising human tendency to
  conflate own thoughts with divine leading.

#### Determining Cultural Specificity vs. Transcultural Application

- ##### Assumption of Transcultural

  Assume transcultural applicability for biblical
  commands unless strong evidence to the contrary.

- ##### Evidence Sources

  Both textual indicators and Church tradition may provide
  evidence.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) on both the overall framework and the
  assumption of transcultural applicability unless proven otherwise.

#### Textual Markers of Transcultural Principles

- Appeals to creation order or God's character.
- Repetition across multiple books or contexts.
- Explicit theological reasoning by biblical author ("because" or "for"
  clauses).
- Statements indicating universal application (e.g., "this is my rule in all the
  churches").
- Connection to moral law rooted in God's nature.

#### Traditional Distinctions

- Ceremonial, Civil, and Moral Law: Recognise traditional distinction whilst
  acknowledging categories often overlap and are not always clear-cut.

#### Situational Instructions

- ##### Non-Repeatable Circumstances

  Instructions tied to specific, non-repeatable
  circumstances (Paul's request for cloak, Jesus' command to rich young ruler to
  sell everything) are situational rather than extracting universal behavioural
  principles.

#### Role of Church Tradition

- ##### Valid Evidence

  Church tradition serves as valid evidence in discerning
  cultural specificity (e.g., widespread acceptance of cultural equivalents to
  "holy kiss" suggests application flexibility).

- ##### Scripture Trumps Tradition

  When Scripture explicitly grounds command in
  transcultural realities (e.g., creation order), that command retains universal
  applicability regardless of evolving Church practice.

### Handling Difficult and Unclear Passages

#### Encountering Unclear Passages

- ##### Acceptable Uncertainty

  It is acceptable to say "I don't know what this
  means."

- ##### Meaning Exists

  The passage will have meaning that accords with the rest of
  Scripture.

- ##### Apprehensible with Study

  That meaning will be apprehensible given enough
  study, contextual knowledge, and the Spirit's illumination.

- ##### None Impossible

  Some passages are difficult to comprehend, but none are
  impossible.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

#### Interpreting Unclear Passages

- ##### In Light of Clear

  Unclear passages should certainly be interpreted in light
  of clear passages. This is an important hermeneutic.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Strong (4) - could be dissuaded by very strong
  counter-argument.

#### Passages with Orthodox Disagreement

- ##### Careful Evaluation

  Each disputed passage should be evaluated carefully using
  hermeneutical principles already discussed.

- ##### Some Relatively Clear

  Some disputed passages (e.g., women's roles, spiritual
  gifts) are relatively clear and shouldn't be as debated as they are.

- ##### Some Genuinely Unclear

  Other passages are genuinely unclear (e.g., correct
  interpretation of Romans 7).

- ##### Humility Based on Clarity

  Appropriate level of humility should be primarily
  based on the clarity of the passage itself, with level of disagreement within
  orthodoxy impacting humility only secondarily.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Strong (4) on overall approach. Moderate (3) on
  interpretations of specific disputed passages deemed relatively clear (though
  confidence may vary by individual passage).

#### Clarity and Theological Centrality

- ##### Affects Centrality

  The difficulty or clarity of a passage should affect how
  central it should be to one's theology.

- ##### Core Doctrines

  Unclear passages should not be used to establish core
  doctrines.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Strong (4) - could be dissuaded by very strong
  counter-argument.

### Additional Hermeneutical Principles

#### Analogy of Faith

- ##### Harmony with Foundational Doctrines

  Scripture should be interpreted in
  harmony with foundational Christian doctrines.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Strong (4) - could be dissuaded by very strong
  counter-argument.

#### Role of Reason and Logic

- ##### Ministerial Role

  Reason and logic play important but ministerial (not
  magisterial) role in interpretation, in the sense used by Francis Turretin.

- ##### Serving Scripture

  Reason serves Scripture and does not rule over it.

- ##### Necessary Philosophical Presuppositions

  Some fundamental philosophical
  presuppositions unavoidably assume magisterial role (e.g., belief in external
  reality, ability to know something with useful level of confidence).

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

#### Prophecy and Predictive Passages

- ##### General Principles Apply

  General hermeneutical principles already discussed
  apply to predictive texts.

- ##### Cross-Reference with History

  Predictive texts should be carefully
  cross-referenced with historical records to determine if already fulfilled.

- ##### Multiple Fulfilments

  The concept of multiple fulfilments of single prophecy
  is affirmed, often with lesser fulfilment first followed by later, greater
  fulfilment.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Very strong (5) on applying general principles and
  cross-referencing with history. Moderate (3) on multiple fulfilments.

## The Canon of Scripture

### Formation and Recognition

#### Divine Authority

- ##### Canonical Criterion

  A writing is canonical Scripture if, and only if, it was
  breathed out by God (2 Timothy 3:16).

- ##### Church Recognition

  The Church recognised books that already possessed divine
  authority; the Church did not confer authority upon them.

- ##### Role of Councils

  Church councils played limited role in helping the Church
  recognise the canon but did not establish it.

- ##### Marks of Canonicity

  Apostolic authorship or approval, the Holy Spirit's
  witness to the Church, and the internal qualities of the books themselves all
  served as clues helping the Church recognise which books were breathed out by
  God and divinely appointed to be recorded as Scripture.

- ##### Confidence Level

  High (5).

### Closure of the Canon

#### No New Scripture

- ##### Closed Canon

  The canon is closed; no new books can be added to Scripture.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Very strong (5) - would require overwhelmingly strong
  argument to be dissuaded.

- ##### Importance Rating

  High (5) - denying this is heterodox but not heresy; a
  serious error that will severely impact one's Christian walk.

- ##### Distinction from Prophecy

  Other prophecy (not recorded as Scripture) may also
  be breathed out by God, but the nature of these prophecies (e.g., limited
  scope) and the Spirit's guidance did not lead the Church to recognise them as
  Scripture.

### The Deuterocanonical Books

#### Status and Use

- ##### Not Authoritative Scripture

  The books included in Catholic and Orthodox
  canons but not in the Protestant canon (Tobit, Judith, 1-2 Maccabees, Wisdom,
  Sirach, Baruch, additions to Esther and Daniel) are useful for historical
  understanding but are not authoritative Scripture.

- ##### Use in Teaching

  May be read in church services and used for teaching, but
  only as aids to exegesis of canonical Scripture.

- ##### Caution Required

  Care should be taken to prevent listeners from thinking of
  these books as Scripture.

- ##### Bible Printing

  Preference is that deuterocanonical books not be printed in
  Bibles to maintain clear distinction between canon and other writings, though
  this is not strongly held; if included, clear separation from canonical text
  is essential.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Low (2) - held lightly regarding their use in teaching.

## Relationship Between Old and New Testaments

### Four Relational Frameworks

The Old and New Testaments relate to one another through multiple complementary
frameworks, none of which needs to be ranked above the others:

#### 1. Promise and Fulfilment

- The Old Testament contains promises that find their fulfilment in the New
  Testament, supremely in Christ.

#### 2. Type and Antitype

- Old Testament persons, events, and institutions were real and served genuine
  purposes in their own contexts, whilst also foreshadowing greater realities
  fulfilled in Christ and the New Covenant.

- ##### Terminology

  "Type and antitype" is preferred over "shadow and reality"
  because the types were absolutely real, even as they pointed forward.

#### 3. Continuity with Discontinuity

- The testaments share fundamental continuity in God's character, purposes, and
  moral standards.
- Significant discontinuity exists in covenantal arrangements, ceremonial
  requirements, and the progressive unfolding of redemption.

#### 4. Progressive Revelation

- God progressively revealed His character, purposes, and redemptive plan
  throughout history.
- Fuller revelation came in the New Testament and supremely in Christ, "the
  exact imprint of his nature" (Hebrews 1:3).

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.

- ##### Importance Rating

  Moderate (3) - Christians within the same fellowship might
  disagree.

## The Mosaic Law and Christian Ethics

### Fulfilment in Christ

#### Vicarious Fulfilment

- ##### Christ Fulfilled All

  Christ fulfilled all the law.

- ##### United to Christ

  Christians vicariously fulfil the law by being united to
  Christ.

- ##### Not Under Mosaic Covenant

  Christians are not under the Mosaic Covenant as a
  covenant system.

### Indirect Applicability of the Law

Though Christians are not obligated to keep the Mosaic Law, the entire Law
retains indirect applicability to Christian life:
- Points to Christ.
- Reveals God's character.
- Exemplifies being set apart for the Lord.
- Exemplifies personal and societal morality (e.g., concern for vulnerable
  members of society).
- Benefits of (voluntary) Sabbath-keeping.
- Many other ways the Law can be applied to Christian life exist beyond these
  examples.

### Determining Binding Laws

When discerning which Old Testament moral standards remain binding:

#### Covenant-People vs. All-People Laws

- Laws given outside the Mosaic Covenant or explicitly applied to Gentile
  nations are typically binding for all people across all time.
- Fine-tuning needed for edge cases (e.g., circumcision is not uniquely Mosaic
  but Christians are not obliged to follow it).
- Better distinction may be "covenant-people only" laws versus "all people"
  laws.

#### Gentile Judgements

- Attention should be paid to reasons for judgements wrought against Gentile
  nations in the Old Testament, as these reveal universal moral standards.

#### New Testament Reaffirmation

- When New Testament epistles restate an Old Testament law, this generally
  indicates the law has been carried over into the Church era and remains
  binding upon Christians.

#### Caution with Gospel Accounts

- Care must be taken when interpreting Jesus' words in the Gospels, as He was
  primarily speaking to people still living under the Old Covenant.
- Careful examination of context is required.

#### Grey Areas

- Careful Bible study will clarify which laws were for Israel only and which
  were for all people.

- ##### Example

  The advice to avoid blood and strangled animals (Acts 15) represents
  a grey area requiring careful consideration.

### Examples and Applications

#### Ceremonial and Civil Laws

- Laws unique to Israel's covenant status (such as circumcision post-Christ,
  dietary restrictions, festivals, temple rituals) are not binding on
  Christians.

#### Universal Moral Laws

- Laws reflecting God's unchanging character and applied beyond Israel (such as
  prohibitions on murder, adultery, theft, idolatry, sexual immorality) remain
  binding.

- ##### Confidence Level

  Moderate (3) - the framework needs refinement for edge
  cases, though strong confidence exists that Christians are not required to
  keep Mosaic laws never applied to Gentiles.

## Theological Framework

### Molinism (Middle Knowledge)

#### Nature and Purpose

- ##### Middle Knowledge

  God knows what free-will choice any creature will make in any circumstance,
  including all counterfactual truths.

- ##### Purpose

  This framework reconciles divine sovereignty with libertarian human freedom.

- ##### Confidence

  High (5 on personal scale).

---

## II. Theology Proper (Doctrine of God)

### Essential Attributes All held with highest confidence (5-6):

- #### Trinity

  One being in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)

- #### Aseity

  Self-existing, necessary, non-contingent being

- #### Eternality

  No beginning or end; exists outside created time but entered
  time at creation

- #### Omnipresence

  Present throughout all creation while remaining distinct
  from it

- #### Omniscience

  Knows all truth, including future events and counterfactuals
  (via middle knowledge)

- #### Transcendence and Immanence

  Both beyond creation and actively present
  within it

- #### Greatest Being

  That of which nothing greater can be conceived

### Divine Sovereignty

- #### Sovereignty and Freedom

  God knowingly allows every event that occurs

- #### Molinist Framework

  God exercises meticulous providence through middle
  knowledge while respecting libertarian free will

- #### Time and God

  God entered into time when He created it (presentist view)

---

## III. Christology

All Christological affirmations held with the highest confidence (5-6):

### Person of Christ

- #### Deity

  Jesus is the Son of God, consubstantial with the Father

- #### Incarnation

  Added human nature to divine nature; fully God and fully
  human

- #### Virgin Birth

  Mary was virgin until after Jesus' birth

- #### Creator

  All things made through Christ

- #### Messiah

  Fulfilment of Hebrew Scriptures' prophecies

### Work of Christ

- #### Crucifixion

  Died under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried

- #### Resurrection

  Rose bodily on the third day

- #### Ascension

  Ascended to heaven, seated at the Father's right hand

- #### Second Coming

  Will return to judge living and dead

- #### Revelation

  Jesus is the full revelation of God's nature and character

---

## IV. Anthropology and Hamartiology

### Nature of Humanity

- #### Image of God

  Humans created male and female in God's image, sharing
  attributes to finite extent

- #### Two Genders

  Only male and female, corresponding to biological sex

- #### Purpose

  Created as recipients of God's love; chief end is to glorify and
  enjoy God forever

- #### Libertarian Free Will

  Humans possess genuine libertarian freedom

- #### Historicity

  Adam and Eve were actual historical people (lived 6,000 to
  1,000,000 years ago)

### Original Sin and the Fall

#### Key Distinctive : Corruption without inherited guilt

- #### Corrupted Nature

  All humans inherit Adam's corrupted nature (tendency
  toward sin, spiritual brokenness)

- #### No Inherited Guilt

  Adam's descendants are NOT guilty of his sin at birth;
  guilt requires personal moral agency

- #### Total Depravity

  All aspects of human nature affected by the Fall

- #### Physical Death

  Universal consequence of Adam's sin
  (corporate/biological), but not personal punishment for those without guilt

- #### Enmity with God

  Unregenerate persons are enemies of God due to personal
  sin once accountable

### Sin

- #### Definition

  Failure to follow God's commands; offence against God

- #### Moral Agency Requirement

  Sin only incurs guilt when committed with moral
  agency (ability to choose otherwise)

- #### Infants and Sin

  Infants manifest sinful actions (as "sinners" = "people
  who sin") but without moral culpability

- #### Age of Accountability

  Varies by individual based on cognitive/moral
  development; exact timing known only to God

- #### Cognitively Disabled

  Those who never develop moral agency remain in
  innocent state throughout life

### Infant and Child Soteriology

#### Distinctive Position : Innocence until accountability

- #### Before Accountability

  Children are legally innocent, having corrupted
  nature but no personal guilt

- #### Need for Atonement

  Christ's work addresses corrupted nature, enabling
  children to remain in relationship with God

- #### Status

  Children of believers are "holy"&mdash;
  set apart in covenant community (per 1 Cor 7:14)

- #### Salvation of Infants

  Those who die before accountability are saved (no
  guilt to condemn them)

- #### Parental Responsibility

  Parents should disciple children toward faith as
  understanding develops

- #### Young Conversion

  Children can exercise saving faith as young as 4 years
  old with basic understanding ("I need Jesus")

## V. Soteriology (Doctrine of Salvation)

### Arminian Framework Strongly held positions (confidence 3-5):

#### The Five Articles of Remonstrance (Arminian Distinctive)

1.  ##### Conditional Election

    God elected a people (Israel, then the Church by adoption);
    individuals become elect when they trust in Christ.

2.  ##### Universal Atonement

    Christ's atoning work was on behalf of and sufficient for all people.

3.  ##### Total Depravity with Prevenient Grace

    No one can come to God unless God first calls and enables them;
    all receive prevenient grace.

4.  ##### Resistible Grace

    God grants people ability to reject His call to salvation.

5.  ##### Perseverance

    *Uncertain*&mdash;
    leans toward belief that regenerate believers may fall away,
    but holds with very low confidence
    (this is a subject of ongoing study).

### Prevenient Grace

- #### Nature

  Supernatural grace given to all people, enabling free acceptance
  or rejection of God's call

- #### Function

  Restores capacity for moral response lost in the Fall

- #### Application

  May work gradually or immediately; all God's preparatory work
  precedes faith

- #### Infants

  Exact mechanics unclear; ensures all have genuine opportunity to
  respond

### Atonement Theories&mdash;Multiple Aspects Affirmed

- #### Penal Substitutionary

  Christ bore punishment for our sins

- #### Ransom

  Christ paid ransom to deliver from bondage to sin

- #### Propitiation

  Christ's death satisfied God's wrath against sin

- #### Effectual Application

  Becomes effective when person repents and trusts
  Christ

### Justification and Sanctification

- #### Justification

  Instantaneous, forensic declaration of righteousness by
  faith alone

- #### Initial Sanctification

  Begins simultaneously with justification at
  regeneration

- #### Progressive Sanctification

  Holy Spirit begins process of growth in
  holiness at new birth

- #### Relationship

  Cannot have justification without sanctification beginning

- #### Complete Freedom from Sin

  Only achieved at glorification, not in this
  life

- #### Asymptotic Progress

  Believers grow progressively toward holiness but
  never achieve sinless perfection in this life

#### Major Difference from Wesleyanism :
Rejects entire sanctification/Christian perfection as attainable in this life

### Faith and Works

- #### Justification

  By faith alone; works have no merit in justification

- #### Necessity of Works

  Saving faith necessarily produces good works as
  evidence

- #### Relationship

  Faith is the root, works are the fruit

### Assurance

- #### Direct Witness

  Comes through Holy Spirit's witness to believer's spirit

- #### Indirect Witness

  Confirmed by fruit of sanctification over time

- #### False Assurance

  Purported Spirit witness without evidence of
  sanctification is likely illusory

- #### Confidence

  High (5)

---

## VI. Ecclesiology and Church Practice

### Nature of the Church

- #### Universal Church

  The invisible body of all true believers where salvation
  occurs

- #### Local Church

  Membership essential for normal Christian life, though not
  strictly necessary for salvation itself

- #### Social Holiness

  Christianity must be lived in community; believers need
  fellowship and accountability

- #### Church Authority

  Any person or organisation attempting to issue binding
  decrees on all believers' consciences is antichrist

### Church Offices

- #### Biblical Offices Only

  Elder (pastor, overseer, bishop) and deacon

- #### Eldership

  Only men may serve as elders; must be "one-woman men" (faithful
  if married, chaste if single); divorced men may serve in some circumstances.

- #### Deacons

  Both men and women may serve.

- #### Titles

  Elders should not use titles like "pastor" or "father" (held
  lightly, confidence 2).

- #### Church Membership

  Formal membership to a local congregation should be encouraged.
  Because such membership bestows additional benefits, responsibilities and
  authority (as when matters of discipline are brought before the church, per
  Matthew 18:17), the role of "church member" (or "congregant"), may be
  considered similar to a church office.

- #### Authority Structure

  - Prophets and apostles (missionaries) are subject to elder authority.

### Church Mission

- #### Evangelism

  Primary mission, addressing eternal salvation.

- #### Social Action

  Mandatory but secondary; flows from genuine faith.

- #### Balance

  Both are essential expressions of the gospel.

- #### Not Dominionist

  The Church is not expected to control the secular world until Christ returns.

- #### Political Engagement

  It is a good for society for Christians to vote, pursue political offices,
  and otherwise be politically engaged.
  Political activity should be encouraged.

---

## VII. Sacraments and Ordinances

### Baptism

#### Distinctive

Believers' baptism with high sacramental theology

#### Nature and Meaning

- ##### Ordained by Christ

  A ritual commanded by Christ

- ##### Believers Only

  Should only be undertaken by professing believers

- ##### Not Necessary for Salvation

  But necessary for obedience to Christ

- ##### Profession of Faith

  Involves profession of faith and repentance from sin

- ##### Multiple Symbolism

  - Death of old nature and creation of new nature
  - Identification with Christ
  - Induction into Church membership

- ##### Sign and Sacrament

  Both symbol and means of grace

- ##### Supernatural Work

  God does supernatural work at baptism in addition to
  regeneration at first belief

- ##### Duty and Privilege

  Believer's duty and pleasure to seek baptism

#### Mode

- ##### Proper Form

  Full immersion (confidence 3)

- ##### Other Modes Valid

  Those baptised by other modes need not be re-baptised
  (confidence 2, subject to study)

#### Theological Rationale for Believers' Baptism

- Infants have no inherited guilt requiring cleansing
- Baptism signifies personal faith and identification with Christ's
  death/resurrection
- Requires moral agency that infants lack
- Children already "holy" (1 Cor 7:14) in covenant community without baptism

### The Lord's Supper (Eucharist)

#### Distinctive

High sacramental view unusual in Baptist circles

#### Nature

- ##### Ordained by Christ

  A ritual commanded by Christ

- ##### Means of Grace

  Genuine channel through which God conveys grace
  (confidence 2, subject to study)

- ##### Real Spiritual Presence

  Christ is spiritually present; communicates grace
  to worthy receivers

- ##### Not Merely Memorial

  Rejects Zwinglian memorialism

- ##### Not Transubstantiation

  Rejects Roman Catholic doctrine

#### Practice

- ##### Frequency

  Should partake frequently (as often as possible)

- ##### Open to Believers

  All true believers may partake, even if not yet
  baptised

- ##### Closed to Non-Believers

  Non-believers may not partake

---

## VIII. Pneumatology (Doctrine of the Holy Spirit)

### Person of the Spirit

- #### Deity

  Consubstantial with Father and Son.

- #### Work in Salvation

  Regenerates, begins sanctification at conversion,
  continues sanctifying work throughout believer's earthly life, and provides
  assurance.

### Spiritual Gifts

#### Distinctive

Normative continuationism with careful biblical boundaries

#### Position on Gifts

- ##### Continuationism

  All gifts continue throughout the Church age (Pentecost
  to Second Coming)

- ##### Active Today

  Prophecy, tongues, healing, and all gifts should be
  normative in the church

- ##### Biblical Guidelines

  When practiced, must accord with biblical
  instructions

- ##### Testing Required

  All prophecy must be tested against Scripture

#### Contemporary Prophecy

- ##### Divine Source

  God gives prophetic words for guidance, encouragement, and
  direction

- ##### Fallible Reception

  God's words are infallible, but prophet's
  reception/interpretation is fallible

- ##### Scripture Supreme

  All prophecy must be tested against Scripture

- ##### No Contradiction

  No true prophecy will contradict biblical teaching

- ##### Not Scripture-Level Authority

  Does not equal biblical authority

#### Deliverance Ministry

- ##### Demonisation Possible

  Demons can seriously affect believers' lives
  (confidence 2)

- ##### Demonic Control

  Demons can control non-believers' bodies

- ##### Deliverance Available

  Demonised persons can be set free through prayer

#### Balance

- ##### Experience Governed by Scripture

  Religious experience is real and
  important but must be subordinate to rational understanding of Scripture

- ##### Guarding Against Error

  Subjective feelings untethered from biblical truth
  lead to heresy (e.g., Mormon "burning in the bosom")

---

## IX. Means of Grace

### General Principle

- #### Essential Channels

  Means of grace are ordinary channels through which God
  conveys grace

- #### Not Merely Helpful

  Essential for spiritual growth, not optional

- #### God's Ordinary Method

  Grace ordinarily flows through these means, though
  God is not bound by them

### Instituted Means Ordained by Christ:
- Prayer.
- Searching the Scriptures.
- The Lord's Supper.
- Baptism.
- Fasting.
- Christian fellowship (conference).
- Service to the saints (exemplified by foot-washing).

### Prudential Means
- Public worship attendance.
- Good works.
- Self-denial.
- Taking up one's cross.
- Vigilance (watching) - spiritual alertness and awareness, being watchful
  against sin and temptation, maintaining readiness for Christ's return.

### Prayer

- #### Healing

  God heals in response to prayer, both miraculously and by natural
  means

- #### Delayed Healing

  Sometimes God delays healing; sometimes until
  resurrection

- #### Declarative Prayer

  Christians should not declare something in prayer
  unless first revealed by God

---

## X. Christian Life and Ethics

### Sanctification and Holiness

- #### Progressive Growth

  Believers grow in holiness throughout life

- #### Not Perfectionist

  Complete freedom from sin only at glorification

- #### Expectation

  Believers expected to live godly lives and show fruit of
  Spirit

- #### Suffering

  Christians should expect to suffer for following Christ

### Stewardship and Wealth

- #### Three Principles

  Earn all you can, save all you can, give all you can

- #### Generous Giving

  Christians should give generously to local church and
  those in need

- #### Not Legalistic Tithing

  Giving should be determined by Spirit's leading
  and conscience, not necessarily 10%

- #### Subject to Calling

  Economic principles subject to specific divine calling
  (e.g., full-time ministry may require different approach)

- #### Wealth Not Prosperity Gospel

  Rejects notion that prosperity is sign of
  God's blessing

### Marriage and Family

- #### Definition

  Only between one man and one woman

- #### Typology

  Represents Christ's relationship with His Church

- #### Authority Structure

  Husband is spiritual head, lovingly serving wife;
  wife submits to his authority (complementarian)

- #### Divorce

  Prohibited except in specific biblical circumstances

- #### Sexual Ethics

  - Sexual intercourse outside marriage is sinful
  - Homosexual acts are sinful

### Gender Roles

- #### In Marriage

  Complementarian - different roles with husband as head

- #### In Church

  - Only men may be elders
  - Both men and women may be deacons
  - Both men and women may function as prophets as Spirit enables
  - Both may serve as apostles (missionaries)

---

    Everyone who has died will be resurrected to face
    judgement

9.  #### Final Judgement

    Christ will judge everyone for their deeds

10. #### New Creation

    God will destroy and recreate heavens and earth

### Intermediate State

- #### Immediate Consciousness

  Upon death, believers' spirits immediately enter
  God's presence while awaiting bodily resurrection

- #### Awaiting Resurrection

  Not soul sleep; conscious existence in intermediate
  state

### Final States

- #### Hell (Lake of Fire)

  - Those whose names not in Book of Life will be cast into lake of fire
  - Conscious, never-ending torment (not annihilationism)
  - Confidence level: 3 (moderate)

- #### New Heavens and Earth

  Believers resurrected into glorious, supernatural
  bodies

- #### No Purgatory

  Rejects Roman Catholic doctrine

- #### No Universalism

  Not all will be saved

---

## XII. Creation and Science

### Age and Process

#### Old Earth Creationism with Theistic Evolution

- #### Universe Age

  Several billion years old (confidence 2)

- #### Adam's Timing

  Lived 6,000 to 1,000,000 years ago (confidence 1 - very
  uncertain)

- #### Genealogical Gaps

  Adam's genealogy likely contains omissions

- #### Evolution

  God used evolution as one element of His creative work
  (confidence 2)

- #### Progressive Creationism

  God supernaturally intervened at points to
  produce speciation (confidence 1)

- #### Neo-Darwinism

  Neo-Darwinian macroevolution is not scientifically
  plausible (confidence 3)

### Hermeneutics of Genesis

- #### Hermeneutical Freedom

  Various approaches to Genesis 1-6 can be considered
  orthodox

- #### Days of Creation

  Six days should not be interpreted as literal 24-hour
  periods (confidence 3)

- #### Genesis 6 Flood

  Regional event, not global (confidence 2)

- #### Sons of God

  Fallen spiritual beings (confidence 2)

### Theology of Creation

- #### Creator

  Father Almighty is maker of all things visible and invisible

- #### Through Christ

  All things made through Christ

- #### Time

  God created time and entered into it

- #### Sustenance

  God actively sustains all creation, including Satan and demons

- #### Angels and Demons

  Demons are created spiritual beings that are evil

### Philosophy

- #### Anti-Platonism

  Abstract objects do not exist; if they do, they're
  contingent on God (confidence 3)

- #### Presentism

  Only present time exists; past has ceased, future hasn't yet
  come (confidence 3)

---

## XIII. Other Doctrines

### Mariology

- #### Virgin Birth

  Mary was virgin until after Jesus' birth

- #### Other Children

  Mary did not remain perpetually virgin; bore other
  children

- #### Prayer to Mary

  Attempting to pray to Mary or other departed saints is
  prohibited

- #### No Special Status

  Rejects Catholic Marian dogmas

### Biblical Translations

- #### Multiple Good Translations

  Many very good English translations exist

- #### Modern Advantages

  Modern translations have advantages due to Dead Sea
  Scrolls

- #### Warning

  "The Passion Translation" is dangerous and should be avoided

---

## XIV. Areas of Ongoing Study

## XV. Alignment with Historic Creeds

This section examines alignment with the most significant ecumenical creeds of
historic Christianity. These creeds represent the theological consensus of the
early Church and continue to serve as standards of orthodoxy across the
Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions.

### The Apostles' Creed

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, with full agreement.

The Apostles' Creed represents the most basic and ancient summary of Christian
faith. Full affirmation of all articles:

- Belief in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.
- Belief in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.
- Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary.
- Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
- **Descended into hell/to the dead**: Affirmed - Christ's spirit went to
  Hades/Sheol to proclaim victory between His death and resurrection.
- Rose again from the dead on the third day.
- Ascended into heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father.
- Will come again to judge the living and the dead.
- Belief in the Holy Spirit.

- #### The holy catholic Church

  Affirmed - "catholic" meaning the one, universal
  Church of all true believers.
- The communion of saints.
- The forgiveness of sins.
- The resurrection of the body.
- The life everlasting.

#### Significance

The Apostles' Creed represents the core of Christian orthodoxy and is affirmed
without reservation.

### The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (Nicene Creed)

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, with full agreement.

This creed, formulated at the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381),
provides the definitive statement on Trinitarian and Christological orthodoxy.
Full affirmation of all articles:

#### On the Father

- One God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things
  visible and invisible.

#### On the Son

- One Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God.
- Begotten of the Father before all worlds.
- God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God.
- Begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father.
- By whom all things were made.
- Who for us and for our salvation came down from heaven.
- Was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.
- Was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried.
- Rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures.
- Ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father.
- Shall come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead.
- Whose kingdom shall have no end.

#### On the Holy Spirit

- The Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life.
- Who proceeds from the Father (note: see discussion of *filioque* below).
- Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified.
- Who spoke by the prophets.

#### On the Church and Sacraments

- #### One holy catholic and apostolic Church

  Affirmed - "catholic" meaning
  universal; the Church is one, holy, universal, and built on apostolic
  foundation.

- #### One baptism for the forgiveness of sins

  Affirmed with nuance - "one
  baptism" meaning baptism into Christ is the only valid baptism regardless of
  particular mode; "for the forgiveness of sins" is affirmed in that baptism
  should quickly follow faith, and Scripture often treats regeneration and
  baptism as a single event, though if baptism is delayed, forgiveness is still
  applied through faith in anticipation of baptism.
- The resurrection of the dead.
- The life of the world to come.

#### The *Filioque* Question

The original creed states the Spirit "proceeds from the Father." The Western
Church later added "*and the Son*" (*filioque*). The position held here is that
the Spirit "proceeds from the Father, through the Son" - closer to the Eastern
Orthodox formulation. However, this does not constitute rejection of the Western
addition; rather, agnosticism regarding the precise mechanism of procession is
maintained. The Spirit's procession is somehow related to the Son, whether
"from" or "through" the Son, but strict insistence on one formulation over the
other is avoided.

#### Significance

The Nicene Creed represents the definitive statement of Trinitarian orthodoxy
and is affirmed in its fullness.

### The Chalcedonian Definition (451)

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, complete agreement.

The Definition of Chalcedon provides the orthodox formulation of Christ's two
natures. Full affirmation:

- Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man.
- Of a reasonable soul and body.
- Consubstantial with the Father according to His Godhead.
- Consubstantial with us according to His manhood.
- Like us in all things, sin only excepted.
- **One and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two
  natures:**
  - **Without confusion** (the natures are not mixed).
  - **Without change** (the natures are not altered).
  - **Without division** (the natures are not separated into two persons).
  - **Without separation** (the natures remain united in one person).
- The distinction of natures is in no way abolished by their union.
- Rather, the property of each nature is preserved.
- Both natures concur in one person and one subsistence.
- Not parted or divided into two persons.
- But one and the same Son, Only-begotten, God the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ.

#### Significance

The Chalcedonian Definition is the gold standard for Christological orthodoxy,
guarding against all major heresies (Nestorianism, Eutychianism,
Apollinarianism, Arianism). It is affirmed completely and without qualification.

### The Athanasian Creed

**Overall Affirmation**: Yes, with one significant qualification.

The Athanasian Creed (likely 5th-6th century) provides the most detailed
exposition of Trinitarian theology among the ecumenical creeds. It is affirmed
in its theological content with one important pastoral qualification.

#### Trinitarian Theology

Fully Affirmed:
- The catholic (universal) faith is to worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in
  Unity.
- Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.
- The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God.
- Yet there are not three Gods, but one God.
- The three persons are co-eternal and co-equal.
- Each is uncreated, incomprehensible, eternal, almighty, Lord, and God.
- Yet not three uncreated, incomprehensible, eternal, almighty, or Gods, but
  one.

#### Christology

Fully Affirmed:
- Perfect God and perfect man.
- Of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.
- Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead.
- Inferior to the Father as touching His manhood.
- One Christ, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the
  manhood into God.
- One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.

#### Procession of the Spirit

Affirmed with Nuance:

The creed states: "The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son: not made, nor
created, nor begotten, but proceeding."

This represents the Western (*filioque*) position. As noted above, the position
held here is that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, closer to
the Eastern formulation. However, the Western formulation is not rejected;
rather, agnosticism is maintained about the precise mechanism. The creed's
affirmation that the Spirit's procession is somehow related to the Son is
affirmed, whether expressed as "from" or "through."

#### Damnatory Clauses

Qualified:

The creed contains strong language: "Whosoever will be saved, before all things
it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith except every one do
keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly."

#### Qualification

Whilst Trinitarian orthodoxy is essential to Christianity and represents
fundamental truth, this strong formulation is qualified pastorally. Trinitarian
orthodoxy is necessary for the mature believers who have had opportunity to
understand it, but salvation is not denied to the new or simple believers who
have genuine faith in Christ but have not yet grasped the full Trinitarian
theology. The thief on the cross, for instance, was saved through simple faith
in Christ without articulating the Nicene theology.

This qualification does not represent the rejection of Trinitarian orthodoxy's
importance, but rather the pastoral sensitivity to believers at different stages
of theological understanding.

#### Significance

The Athanasian Creed represents the most thorough articulation of Trinitarian
theology in creedal form. Its theological content is affirmed, with the pastoral
qualification on its damnatory clauses.

### Summary of Creedal Alignment

#### Full Affirmation

- Apostles' Creed (100%)
- Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (100%, with acknowledged nuance on *filioque*)
- Chalcedonian Definition (100%)

#### Qualified Affirmation

- Athanasian Creed (theological content 100%; pastoral qualification on
  damnatory clauses)

This creedal alignment places this theological position firmly within **the
historic Christian orthodoxy** as recognised by the Catholic, Orthodox, and
Protestant traditions. The nuances on the *filioque* and the pastoral
qualification on the Athanasian Creed's damnatory clauses represent careful
theological distinctions rather than the departure from orthodoxy.

The affirmation of these creeds demonstrates the commitment to:
- The Nicene Trinitarianism.
- The Chalcedonian Christology.
- The unity and catholicity of the Church.
- The historic Christian orthodoxy across traditions.
- The ecumenical consensus of the early Church.

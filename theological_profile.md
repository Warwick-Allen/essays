## About This Document

This theological profile presents a systematic overview of personal theological convictions, organised by major doctrinal categories. It is intended to provide clarity on theological positions for pastors, church leaders, fellow believers, and anyone interested in understanding this particular theological framework.

### Confidence and Importance Indicators

Throughout this document, certain beliefs are marked with **confidence levels** and **importance ratings**:

**Confidence Levels** (scale of 1-6):
- **6**: Maximum confidence - as certain as belief in the external world; unlikely to ever be dissuaded.
- **5**: Very strong confidence - would require overwhelmingly strong argument to be dissuaded.
- **4**: Strong confidence - could be dissuaded by very strong counter-argument.
- **3**: Moderate confidence - could be dissuaded by good counter-argument.
- **2**: Held lightly - could easily be dissuaded given new information or argumentation.
- **1**: Undecided on this matter.

**Importance Ratings** (scale of 1-6):
- **6**: Fundamental doctrine of Christianity; denying this is heresy and might put one's salvation in jeopardy.
- **5**: Denying this is heterodox but not heresy; a serious error that will severely impact one's Christian walk.
- **4**: Important topic with room for disagreement within orthodox Christianity.
- **3**: Moderate importance; Christians within the same fellowship might disagree.
- **2**: Low importance; Christians should not spend much time debating this.
- **1**: Mere curiosity of negligible importance.

**Areas of Ongoing Study**: Where importance exceeds confidence by 2 or more points, the topic is subject to ongoing study and theological development.

## Executive Summary

This theological profile represents a thoughtful and internally coherent synthesis of beliefs drawn from multiple Christian traditions. The core commitments are:

1. **Molinist Arminian Soteriology** - emphasising libertarian free will, universal atonement, and prevenient grace.
2. **Baptist Ecclesiology and Sacramentology** - believers' baptism, regenerate church membership, but with unusually high sacramental theology.
3. **Charismatic Pneumatology** - normative continuationism with careful biblical testing.
4. **Progressive Sanctification** - rejecting entire sanctification as attainable in this life in favour of asymptotic growth towards holiness.
5. **Reformed Baptist Anthropology** - corrupted nature without inherited guilt before accountability.

This combination places the holder within the **Free Will Baptist** theological stream, with significant charismatic convictions and philosophical sophistication through Molinism.

## I. Theological Method and Authority

### Scripture and Authority
- **Primary Position**: Scripture is the supreme and sufficient authority for all matters of faith and practice.
- **Core Doctrines**: For the essential doctrines (salvation, Christ's person and work), Scripture alone suffices (closer to *sola scriptura*).
- **Secondary Matters**: Tradition (especially the early Church Fathers), reason, and experience serve as valuable interpretive tools with genuine theological authority.
- **Confidence Level**: High (5-6 on the personal scale).

**Alignment**: Shares the Protestant commitment to biblical authority with the Reformed, Baptist, and evangelical traditions, whilst incorporating a more Anglican/Wesleyan appreciation for tradition, reason, and experience as interpretive aids.

### Hermeneutics
- **Biblical Inspiration**: Plenary verbal inspiration - all parts of the Scripture are equally inspired by God.
- **Infallibility**: Didactic infallibility - everything the Bible intends to teach is infallible and authoritative.
- **Inerrancy Nuance**: The Bible may contain errors in incidental, non-didactic statements, but this doesn't deny divine superintendence.
- **Perspicuity**: The core doctrines necessary for salvation are sufficiently clear for all people to understand.
- **Canon**: The 66 books of the Protestant canon are the only authoritative books.
- **Preservation**: Divine preservation ensures no errors in transmission impact any core doctrines.

**Alignment**: Aligns with the evangelical and Reformed understanding of biblical authority, whilst allowing for a nuance on inerrancy that some conservative evangelicals also hold.

### Theological Framework
- **Molinism (Middle Knowledge)**: God knows what free-will choice any creature will make in any circumstance, including all counterfactual truths.
- **Purpose**: This framework reconciles divine sovereignty with libertarian human freedom.
- **Confidence**: High (5 on the personal scale).

**Alignment**: Shares the philosophical framework with Molinist theologians like Luis de Molina, William Lane Craig, and Thomas Flint; provides a distinctively Arminian approach to sovereignty and freedom.

---

## II. Theology Proper (Doctrine of God)

### Essential Attributes
All held with the highest confidence (5-6):
- **Trinity**: One being in three persons (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit).
- **Eternal Processions**: The Son proceeds from the Father; the Spirit proceeds from the Father, through the Son; these processions are ontological and eternal (importance 4-5, confidence 5-6).
- **Aseity**: Self-existing, necessary, non-contingent being.
- **Eternality**: No beginning or end; exists outside created time but entered time at creation.
- **Omnipresence**: Present throughout all creation whilst remaining distinct from it.
- **Omniscience**: Knows all truth, including future events and counterfactuals (via middle knowledge).
- **Transcendence and Immanence**: Both beyond creation and actively present within it.
- **Greatest Being**: That of which nothing greater can be conceived.

**Alignment**: These doctrines represent historic Christian orthodoxy affirmed by the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and evangelical traditions universally.

### Divine Sovereignty
- **Sovereignty and Freedom**: God knowingly allows every event that occurs.
- **Molinist Framework**: God exercises meticulous providence through middle knowledge whilst respecting libertarian free will.
- **Time and God**: God entered into time when He created it (the presentist view).

**Alignment**: The Molinist framework distinguishes this from both the strict Calvinist sovereignty (determinism) and open theism (limited foreknowledge), whilst maintaining a robust divine sovereignty.

---

## III. Christology

All Christological affirmations held with the highest confidence (5-6):

### Person of Christ
- **Deity**: Jesus is the Son of God, consubstantial with the Father.
- **Incarnation**: Added human nature to divine nature; fully God and fully human.
- **Virgin Birth**: Mary was virgin until after Jesus' birth.
- **Creator**: All things made through Christ.
- **Messiah**: Fulfilment of Hebrew Scriptures' prophecies.

### Work of Christ
- **Crucifixion**: Died under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried.
- **Resurrection**: Rose bodily on the third day.
- **Ascension**: Ascended to heaven, seated at the Father's right hand.
- **Second Coming**: Will return to judge living and dead.
- **Revelation**: Jesus is the full revelation of God's nature and character.

**Alignment**: These Christological affirmations represent the historic Christian orthodoxy enshrined in the Nicene and Chalcedonian creeds, affirmed across the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and evangelical traditions.

---

## IV. Anthropology and Hamartiology

### Nature of Humanity
- **Image of God**: Humans created male and female in God's image, sharing attributes to a finite extent.
- **Two Genders**: Only male and female, corresponding to biological sex.
- **Purpose**: Created as recipients of God's love; the chief end is to glorify and enjoy God forever.
- **Libertarian Free Will**: Humans possess genuine libertarian freedom.
- **Historicity**: Adam and Eve were actual historical people (lived 6,000 to 1,000,000 years ago).

**Alignment**: The image of God and human purpose align with all Christian traditions. Libertarian free will aligns with the Arminian, Wesleyan, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions (contra the Reformed/Calvinist compatibilism). The Westminster Catechism's "chief end" statement is affirmed.

### Original Sin and the Fall
**Key Distinctive**: Corruption without inherited guilt.

- **Corrupted Nature**: All humans inherit Adam's corrupted nature (tendency towards sin, spiritual brokenness).
- **No Inherited Guilt**: Adam's descendants are NOT guilty of his sin at birth; guilt requires personal moral agency.
- **Total Depravity**: All aspects of human nature affected by the Fall.
- **Physical Death**: Universal consequence of Adam's sin (corporate/biological), but not personal punishment for those without guilt.
- **Enmity with God**: Unregenerate persons are enemies of God due to personal sin once accountable.

**Alignment**: Total depravity aligns with the Reformed theology. The position on corruption without inherited guilt aligns with many Free Will Baptists, some Anabaptists, and Churches of Christ, whilst differing from the Reformed, Catholic, Orthodox, and Wesleyan positions that affirm inherited guilt.

### Sin
- **Definition**: Failure to follow God's commands; offence against God.
- **Moral Agency Requirement**: Sin only incurs guilt when committed with moral agency (ability to choose otherwise).
- **Infants and Sin**: Infants manifest sinful actions (as "sinners" = "people who sin") but without moral culpability.
- **Age of Accountability**: Varies by individual based on cognitive/moral development; exact timing known only to God.
- **Cognitively Disabled**: Those who never develop moral agency remain in innocent state throughout life.

**Alignment**: The age of accountability theology is common in the Baptist and evangelical circles, though the philosophical grounding in libertarian free will and moral agency is more sophisticated than the typical formulations.

### Infant and Child Soteriology
**Distinctive Position**: Innocence until accountability.

- **Before Accountability**: Children are legally innocent, having corrupted nature but no personal guilt.
- **Need for Atonement**: Christ's work addresses corrupted nature, enabling children to remain in relationship with God.
- **Status (1 Cor 7:14)**: Children of believers are "holy" - set apart in covenant community.
- **Salvation of Infants**: Those who die before accountability are saved (no guilt to condemn them).
- **Parental Responsibility**: Parents should disciple children towards faith as understanding develops.
- **Young Conversion**: Children can exercise saving faith as young as 4 years old with basic understanding ("I need Jesus").

**Alignment**: This position is held by many Free Will Baptists, some Anabaptist traditions, and Churches of Christ. It differs from the Reformed (some affirm infant guilt with elect infants saved), Catholic/Orthodox (baptismal regeneration removes original guilt), and Wesleyan (inherited guilt removed by baptism) positions.

---

## V. Soteriology (Doctrine of Salvation)

### Arminian Framework
Strongly held positions (confidence 3-5):

**The Five Articles of Remonstrance (Arminian Distinctive):**

1. **Conditional Election**: God elected a people (Israel, then the Church by adoption); individuals become elect when they trust in Christ.
2. **Universal Atonement**: Christ's atoning work was on behalf of and sufficient for all people.
3. **Total Depravity with Prevenient Grace**: No one can come to God unless God first calls and enables them; all receive prevenient grace.
4. **Resistible Grace**: God grants people ability to reject His call to salvation.
5. **Perseverance**: *Uncertain* - leans towards belief that regenerate believers may fall away, but holds with very low confidence (ongoing study).

**Alignment**: These positions align with classical Arminianism, Wesleyanism, Free Will Baptist theology, and are shared by many Pentecostal and charismatic traditions. They stand in contrast to the Calvinist/Reformed five points (TULIP). The uncertainty on perseverance represents an open question between the Arminian (conditional security) and Calvinist (eternal security) positions.

### Prevenient Grace
- **Nature**: Supernatural grace given to all people, enabling free acceptance or rejection of God's call.
- **Function**: Restores capacity for moral response lost in the Fall.
- **Application**: May work gradually or immediately; all God's preparatory work precedes faith.
- **Infants**: Exact mechanics unclear; ensures all have genuine opportunity to respond.

**Alignment**: This is a distinctively Arminian and Wesleyan doctrine, also held by the Catholic and Orthodox traditions in different forms. The Reformed theology generally rejects prevenient grace in favour of irresistible grace given only to the elect.

### Atonement Theories
Multiple aspects affirmed:
- **Penal Substitutionary**: Christ bore punishment for our sins.
- **Ransom**: Christ paid ransom to deliver from bondage to sin.
- **Propitiation**: Christ's death satisfied God's wrath against sin.
- **Effectual Application**: Becomes effective when person repents and trusts Christ.

**Alignment**: The penal substitutionary atonement is the predominant evangelical and Reformed understanding. The Catholic, Orthodox, and some Anglican traditions emphasise other atonement theories (Christus Victor, moral influence, recapitulation) alongside or instead of penal substitution. The affirmation of multiple theories represents a comprehensive view held by many evangelicals.

### Justification and Sanctification
- **Justification**: Instantaneous, forensic declaration of righteousness by faith alone.
- **Initial Sanctification**: Begins simultaneously with justification at regeneration.
- **Progressive Sanctification**: Holy Spirit begins process of growth in holiness at new birth and continues throughout earthly life.
- **Relationship**: Cannot have justification without sanctification beginning.
- **Complete Freedom from Sin**: Only achieved at glorification, not in this life.
- **Asymptotic Progress**: Believers grow progressively towards holiness but never achieve sinless perfection in this life.

**Alignment**: The simultaneity of justification and initial sanctification aligns with the Reformed and Wesleyan theology (contra the Catholic progressive justification). The rejection of attainable perfection in this life aligns with the Reformed and most Baptist theology, whilst differing from the Wesleyan-Holiness traditions that affirm entire sanctification or Christian perfection as possible in this life.

### Faith and Works
- **Justification**: By faith alone; works have no merit in justification.
- **Necessity of Works**: Saving faith necessarily produces good works as evidence.
- **Relationship**: Faith is the root, works are the fruit.

**Alignment**: This represents the Protestant consensus on *sola fide*, affirmed by the Reformed, Lutheran, Baptist, and evangelical traditions, distinguishing from the Catholic understanding of faith and works cooperating in justification.

### Assurance
- **Direct Witness**: Comes through Holy Spirit's witness to believer's spirit.
- **Indirect Witness**: Confirmed by fruit of sanctification over time.
- **False Assurance**: Purported Spirit witness without evidence of sanctification is likely illusory.
- **Confidence**: High (5).

**Alignment**: The emphasis on the direct witness of the Spirit aligns with the Wesleyan, Pentecostal, and charismatic traditions. The balance with the indirect witness (sanctification) aligns with the Reformed emphasis on perseverance and fruit. This represents a synthesis of both emphases.

---

## VI. Ecclesiology and Church Practice

### Nature of the Church
- **Universal Church**: The invisible body of all true believers where salvation occurs.
- **Local Church**: Membership essential for normal Christian life, though not strictly necessary for salvation itself.
- **Social Holiness**: Christianity must be lived in community; believers need fellowship and accountability.
- **Church Authority**: Any person or organisation attempting to issue binding decrees on all believers' consciences is antichrist.

**Alignment**: The distinction between the universal and local church is common to the Protestant theology. The emphasis on community aligns with the Wesleyan "social holiness" and the Anabaptist emphasis on the believers' church. The rejection of binding ecclesiastical decrees aligns with the Protestant rejection of papal authority and the congregational/Baptist polity.

### Church Offices
- **Biblical Offices Only**: Elder (pastor, overseer, bishop) and deacon.
- **Plurality of Elders**: Each local congregation should be governed by a plurality of elders who are members of that congregation (importance 4, confidence 3, subject to ongoing study).
- **Eldership**: Only men may serve as elders; must be "one-woman men" (faithful if married, chaste if single); divorced men may serve in some circumstances.
- **Deacons**: Both men and women may serve.
- **Titles**: Elders should not use titles like "pastor" or "father" (held lightly, confidence 2).
- **Authority Structure**: Prophets and apostles (missionaries) subject to elder authority.

**Alignment**: The two-office view aligns with the Baptist and many Reformed churches (contra the Presbyterian three offices including ruling elders, and the Catholic/Orthodox multiple orders). The complementarian position (male-only eldership) aligns with the conservative Baptist, Reformed, and many evangelical churches. Female deacons align with many Baptist churches. The rejection of titles aligns with some Brethren and Anabaptist traditions.

### Church Mission
- **Evangelism**: Primary mission, addressing eternal salvation.
- **Social Action**: Mandatory but secondary; flows from genuine faith.
- **Balance**: Both are essential expressions of the gospel.
- **Not Dominionist**: Church not expected to control secular world until Christ returns.

**Alignment**: The priority of evangelism with mandatory social action represents an evangelical consensus, particularly strong in the Wesleyan and holiness traditions. The rejection of dominionism distinguishes from some Reconstructionist and theonomic Reformed positions.

---

## VII. Sacraments and Ordinances

### Baptism
**Distinctive**: Believers' baptism with high sacramental theology.

**Nature and Meaning:**
- **Ordained by Christ**: A ritual commanded by Christ.
- **Believers Only**: Should only be undertaken by professing believers.
- **Not Necessary for Salvation**: But necessary for obedience to Christ.
- **Profession of Faith**: Involves profession of faith and repentance from sin.
- **Multiple Symbolism**: 
  - Death of old nature and creation of new nature.
  - Identification with Christ.
  - Induction into Church membership.
- **Sign and Sacrament**: Both symbol and means of grace.
- **Supernatural Work**: God does supernatural work at baptism in addition to regeneration at first belief.
- **Duty and Privilege**: Believer's duty and pleasure to seek baptism.
- **Instituted Means of Grace**: One of the channels through which God conveys grace.

**Mode:**
- **Proper Form**: Full immersion (confidence 3).
- **Other Modes Valid**: Those baptised by other modes need not be re-baptised (confidence 2, subject to study).

**Theological Rationale for Believers' Baptism:**
- Infants have no inherited guilt requiring cleansing.
- Baptism signifies personal faith and identification with Christ's death/resurrection.
- Requires moral agency that infants lack.
- Children already "holy" (1 Cor 7:14) in covenant community without baptism.

**Alignment**: The believers' baptism aligns with the Baptist, Anabaptist, Pentecostal, and Churches of Christ traditions. The high sacramental view (baptism as a means of grace with supernatural work) is unusual in the Baptist circles but aligns more with Churches of Christ, some Anabaptist traditions, and even the Anglican/Lutheran understandings (though applied only to believers). The willingness to accept other modes distinguishes from the strict Baptist immersionism. This represents a synthesis of the Baptist convictions with higher sacramental theology.

### The Lord's Supper (Eucharist)
**Distinctive**: High sacramental view unusual in Baptist circles.

**Nature:**
- **Ordained by Christ**: A ritual commanded by Christ.
- **Means of Grace**: Genuine channel through which God conveys grace (confidence 2, subject to study).
- **Real Spiritual Presence**: Christ is spiritually present; communicates grace to worthy receivers.
- **Not Merely Memorial**: Rejects Zwinglian memorialism.
- **Not Transubstantiation**: Rejects Roman Catholic doctrine.
- **Instituted Means of Grace**: One of the channels through which God conveys grace.

**Practice:**
- **Frequency**: Should partake frequently (as often as possible).
- **Open to Believers**: All true believers may partake, even if not yet baptised.
- **Closed to Non-Believers**: Non-believers may not partake.

**Alignment**: The spiritual presence view aligns with the Reformed, Anglican, and Wesleyan theology (contra the Baptist memorialism and the Catholic transubstantiation). Frequent communion aligns with the Wesleyan, Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox practice (contra the typical evangelical quarterly or monthly practice). Open communion for believers aligns with the Baptist and many evangelical churches (contra the Lutheran closed communion and the Catholic/Orthodox requirements).

---

## VIII. Pneumatology (Doctrine of the Holy Spirit)

### Person of the Spirit
- **Deity**: Consubstantial with Father and Son.
- **Work in Salvation**: Regenerates, begins sanctification at conversion, continues sanctifying work throughout believer's earthly life, and provides assurance.

**Alignment**: These doctrines represent historic Christian orthodoxy affirmed across all traditions.

### Spiritual Gifts
**Distinctive**: Normative continuationism with careful biblical boundaries.

**Position on Gifts:**
- **Continuationism**: All gifts continue throughout the Church age (Pentecost to Second Coming).
- **Active Today**: Prophecy, tongues, healing, and all gifts should be normative in the church.
- **Biblical Guidelines**: When practised, must accord with biblical instructions.
- **Testing Required**: All prophecy must be tested against Scripture.

**Contemporary Prophecy:**
- **Divine Source**: God gives prophetic words for guidance, encouragement, and direction.
- **Fallible Reception**: God's words are infallible, but prophet's reception/interpretation is fallible.
- **Scripture Supreme**: All prophecy must be tested against Scripture.
- **No Contradiction**: No true prophecy will contradict biblical teaching.
- **Not Scripture-Level Authority**: Does not equal biblical authority.

**Deliverance Ministry:**
- **Demonisation Possible**: Demons can seriously affect believers' lives (confidence 2).
- **Demonic Control**: Demons can control non-believers' bodies.
- **Deliverance Available**: Demonised persons can be set free through prayer.

**Balance:**
- **Experience Governed by Scripture**: Religious experience is real and important but must be subordinate to rational understanding of Scripture.
- **Guarding Against Error**: Subjective feelings untethered from biblical truth lead to heresy.

**Alignment**: The normative continuationism aligns with the Pentecostal, charismatic, and Third Wave movements, and increasingly with younger evangelicals. The careful biblical testing and Scripture's supremacy over prophecy aligns with the Reformed charismatic theology (e.g., Wayne Grudem, Sam Storms). This distinguishes from the cessationist Reformed, Baptist, and dispensationalist traditions, and from some Pentecostal traditions that give prophecy near-scriptural authority. The balance of Word and Spirit represents thoughtful charismatic theology.

---

## IX. Means of Grace

### General Principle
- **Essential Channels**: Means of grace are ordinary channels through which God conveys grace.
- **Not Merely Helpful**: Essential for spiritual growth, not optional.
- **God's Ordinary Method**: Grace ordinarily flows through these means, though God is not bound by them.

**Alignment**: This high view of the means of grace aligns strongly with the Wesleyan, Anglican, Lutheran, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions, whilst being less emphasised in the typical Baptist and low-church evangelical circles.

### Instituted Means
Ordained by Christ:
- Prayer.
- Searching the Scriptures.
- The Lord's Supper.
- Baptism.
- Fasting.
- Christian fellowship (conference).
- Service to the saints (exemplified by foot-washing).

### Prudential Means
- Public worship attendance.
- Good works.
- Self-denial.
- Taking up one's cross.
- Vigilance (watching) - spiritual alertness and awareness, being watchful against sin and temptation, maintaining readiness for Christ's return.

**Alignment**: This categorisation and emphasis on the means of grace comes from the Wesleyan theology, though the specific means are recognised across many traditions. The inclusion of baptism and service to the saints as instituted means represents a comprehensive sacramental theology.

### Prayer
- **Healing**: God heals in response to prayer, both miraculously and by natural means.
- **Delayed Healing**: Sometimes God delays healing; sometimes until resurrection.
- **Declarative Prayer**: Christians should not declare something in prayer unless first revealed by God.

**Alignment**: The prayer for healing aligns with the charismatic, Pentecostal, and traditional Christian practice. The caution on declarative prayer distinguishes from the "Word of Faith" theology.

---

## X. Christian Life and Ethics

### Sanctification and Holiness
- **Progressive Growth**: Believers grow in holiness throughout life.
- **Not Perfectionist**: Complete freedom from sin only at glorification.
- **Expectation**: Believers expected to live godly lives and show fruit of Spirit.
- **Suffering**: Christians should expect to suffer for following Christ.

**Alignment**: The progressive sanctification without perfectionism aligns with the Reformed, Lutheran, and most Baptist theology. It differs from the Wesleyan-Holiness traditions that affirm entire sanctification as attainable.

### Stewardship and Wealth
- **Three Principles**: Earn all you can, save all you can, give all you can.
- **Generous Giving**: Christians should give generously to local church and those in need.
- **Not Legalistic Tithing**: Giving should be determined by Spirit's leading and conscience, not necessarily 10%.
- **Subject to Calling**: Economic principles subject to specific divine calling (e.g., full-time ministry may require different approach).
- **Wealth Not Prosperity Gospel**: Rejects notion that prosperity is sign of God's blessing.

**Alignment**: The three principles come directly from John Wesley's sermon "The Use of Money," representing the Wesleyan economic ethics. The rejection of legalistic tithing aligns with the New Covenant theology. The rejection of the prosperity gospel aligns with the mainstream evangelical and Reformed theology.

### Marriage and Family
- **Definition**: Only between one man and one woman.
- **Typology**: Represents Christ's relationship with His Church.
- **Authority Structure**: Husband is spiritual head, lovingly serving wife; wife submits to his authority (complementarian).
- **Divorce**: Prohibited except in specific biblical circumstances.
- **Sexual Ethics**: 
  - Sexual intercourse outside marriage is sinful.
  - Homosexual acts are sinful.

**Alignment**: These positions represent the conservative evangelical, Reformed, Baptist, Catholic, and Orthodox consensus on marriage and sexuality. The complementarian position distinguishes from the egalitarian evangelicals.

### Gender Roles
- **In Marriage**: Complementarian - different roles with husband as head.
- **In Church**: 
  - Only men may be elders.
  - Both men and women may be deacons.
  - Both men and women may function as prophets as Spirit enables.
  - Both may serve as apostles (missionaries).

**Alignment**: The complementarianism aligns with the conservative Baptist, Reformed, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions. The allowance for women as deacons and prophets represents a moderate complementarian position (contra the strict complementarianism that restricts all public ministry).

---

## XI. Eschatology (Last Things)

### General Framework
**Premillennialism** (held with humility and low confidence).

### Order of Events
- **Pre-Tribulation Rapture**: Believers taken from earth at start of tribulation (confidence 2).
- **Seven-Year Tribulation**: God will afflict earth's inhabitants.
- **Christ's Return**: Jesus will return to judge living and dead.
- **Millennial Reign**: Christ will reign on earth for 1,000 years.
- **Coexistence**: People with resurrection bodies will coexist with those with natural bodies during millennium.
- **Final Rebellion**: Satan will incite rebellion at end of millennium.
- **Final Battle**: Christ will destroy all who participate.
- **Final Resurrection**: Everyone who has died will be resurrected to face judgement.
- **Final Judgement**: Christ will judge everyone for their deeds.
- **New Creation**: God will destroy and recreate heavens and earth.

### Intermediate State
- **Immediate Consciousness**: Upon death, believers' spirits immediately enter God's presence whilst awaiting bodily resurrection.
- **Awaiting Resurrection**: Not soul sleep; conscious existence in intermediate state.

### Final States
- **Hell (Lake of Fire)**: 
  - Those whose names not in Book of Life will be cast into lake of fire.
  - Conscious, never-ending torment (not annihilationism).
  - Confidence level: 3 (moderate).
- **New Heavens and Earth**: Believers resurrected into glorious, supernatural bodies.
- **No Purgatory**: Rejects Roman Catholic doctrine.
- **No Universalism**: Not all will be saved.

**Alignment**: The premillennialism aligns with the dispensationalist, many Baptist, and Pentecostal traditions. It differs from the amillennialism (Reformed, Lutheran, Catholic) and the postmillennialism (some Reformed). The pre-tribulation rapture is common in the dispensationalist circles. The conscious eternal punishment aligns with the traditional Christian orthodoxy (Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed, Baptist, evangelical), differing from the annihilationism and universalism. The low confidence reflects appropriate humility on the debated eschatological details.

---

## XII. Creation and Science

### Age and Process
**Old Earth Creationism with Theistic Evolution**.

- **Universe Age**: Several billion years old (confidence 2).
- **Adam's Timing**: Lived 6,000 to 1,000,000 years ago (confidence 1 - very uncertain).
- **Genealogical Gaps**: Adam's genealogy likely contains omissions.
- **Evolution**: God used evolution as one element of His creative work (confidence 2).
- **Progressive Creationism**: God supernaturally intervened at points to produce speciation (confidence 1).
- **Neo-Darwinism**: Neo-Darwinian macroevolution is not scientifically plausible (confidence 3).

### Hermeneutics of Genesis
- **Hermeneutical Freedom**: Various approaches to Genesis 1-6 can be considered orthodox.
- **Days of Creation**: Six days should not be interpreted as literal 24-hour periods (confidence 3).
- **Genesis 6 Flood**: Regional event, not global (confidence 2).
- **Sons of God**: Fallen spiritual beings (confidence 2).

### Theology of Creation
- **Creator**: Father Almighty is maker of all things visible and invisible.
- **Through Christ**: All things made through Christ.
- **Time**: God created time and entered into it.
- **Sustenance**: God actively sustains all creation, including Satan and demons.
- **Angels and Demons**: Demons are created spiritual beings that are evil.

### Philosophy
- **Anti-Platonism**: Abstract objects do not exist; if they do, they're contingent on God (confidence 3).
- **Presentism**: Only present time exists; past has ceased, future hasn't yet come (confidence 3).

**Alignment**: The old earth creationism with theistic evolution aligns with many mainline Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox positions, and increasingly with evangelical scholars (e.g., BioLogos, Reasons to Believe frameworks). It differs from the young earth creationism (strict literalist, some Baptist and Reformed traditions) and from purely naturalistic evolution. The allowance for hermeneutical diversity on Genesis aligns with many evangelical statements (e.g., the Lausanne Covenant). The low confidence on many creation topics reflects the ongoing scientific and theological dialogue.

---

## XIII. Other Doctrines

### Mariology
- **Virgin Birth**: Mary was virgin until after Jesus' birth.
- **Other Children**: Mary did not remain perpetually virgin; bore other children.
- **Prayer to Mary**: Attempting to pray to Mary or other departed saints is prohibited.
- **No Special Status**: Rejects Catholic Marian dogmas.

**Alignment**: These positions represent the standard Protestant theology, differing from the Catholic and Orthodox Marian doctrines (perpetual virginity, Immaculate Conception, Assumption, intercession of saints).

### Biblical Translations
- **Multiple Good Translations**: Many very good English translations exist.
- **Modern Advantages**: Modern translations have advantages due to Dead Sea Scrolls.
- **Warning**: "The Passion Translation" is dangerous and should be avoided.

**Alignment**: The openness to multiple translations aligns with the mainstream evangelical scholarship. The rejection of "The Passion Translation" reflects concerns shared by many evangelical biblical scholars.

3. **Modes of Baptism** (∆=2): Whether non-immersion baptisms are valid.
4. **Timing of Adam** (∆=2): When Adam lived.
5. **Baptism as Sacrament** (∆=2): Exact nature of supernatural work at baptism.
6. **Various Creation Topics** (∆=1-2): Details of evolutionary process, flood extent, etc.

## XVI. Theological Identity and Tradition

### Primary Identity
**Molinist Arminian Baptist Charismatic** with high sacramental convictions.

### Closest Denominational Fit
1. **Free Will Baptist** (primary fit).
2. Charismatic Baptist churches with Arminian theology.
3. Churches of Christ (charismatic-leaning).
4. Independent charismatic evangelical churches.
5. Some Vineyard churches.
